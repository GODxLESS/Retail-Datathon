It has a narrow field of view, it's 640x480 (not sure how this qualifies as 'HD'), and the recordings mine take have a repeating stutter to them.  There's also no option to flip the recording, so if you have to mount the camera upside down, your videos will all be upside down.  There's a repeating video glitch on the LCD screen which seems to coincide with the stutter, but it only seldom shows in the recorded video.  The mount is OK, and I appreciate that it uses a standard threaded camera mount. This means I can use other mounts with it.<br /><br />I don't think it was used, but it had the unmistakable smell of cigarette smoke to it.<br /><br />I didn't stick mine on the windshield because here in south Florida, the heat would just melt the thing in one day, so I used a weighted pad/mount on the dash, which means the camera is upside down (and so is the video.)

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Less than $14 for a dash cam that works - SOLD!", "text": "[[VIDEOID:be59e84ee8d9d62a7491c611f75082f2]] Granted, you'll also need an SD card (class 10), but those aren't too expensive.  I went with this one from Transcend: http://amzn.to/1Kj8O8h  $7 for 16GB, not bad.<br /><br />I have the worst luck with vehicles and I've been wanting a dash cam for years, but never looked below the $100 mark.  At one point I was pretty much convinced that I would have to get a GoPro for a dash cam to be any good.  When I stumbled across this one while trying to research a specific (much more expensive) model, I thought to myself &#34;$14?  Geez it's going to suck.  Oh look, video reviews.  That's.... actually not bad.  Oh that guy got hit!  I hope he's okay.  Yep, I'll try it.&#34;<br /><br />So I ordered mine since I just had to get a new vehicle after I was hit from behind and pushed into another vehicle totaling my car.  (I miss my car; it was darn near perfect!)  Now, however, I'm driving this huge SUV that I love, but driving something bigger means there's more area for my vehicle to get hit.  I think I will be buying at least one more of these for the rear of my vehicle, but I want a total of four - one for the front, one for the back, and one for each side!<br /><br />My only two CONS for this item is the mini usb charging cable.  None of the devices I currently have use anything other than micro usb, which means I have no option to share other device cables with this camera.  It's not a huge deal, so I didn't even take away a star, but it is annoying.  The other con was that it was originally in Chinese (I think) and I couldn't figure out how to change the language.  Luckily, some other reviewers figured it out and shared the answer here!  (Still not worth removing a star!)<br /><br />All in all, for $14 I'm thrilled.  I'm not making movies, I'm just trying to make sure that I'm protected if someone hits me again.  True story, I was once sued by a woman who caused a wreck, ruined the front of my new vehicle (less than six months old), and then claimed she couldn't see my car.  If I had this camera in my car, it would have been obvious that she was lying - instead she wasn't even ticketed and the wreck was listed as &#34;unavoidable due to weather conditions&#34; even though the day was crystal clear.  She wouldn't have had a case to sue me, both of the insurance companies, the city, the parish, the state, and the railroad company that owned the tracks I was crossing when she claimed she couldn't see me.  The camera clearly would have shown her face on screen the entire time I was driving up to and over the railroad tracks before she pulled across the road in front of my moving vehicle.  (Stupid people, y'all.  Can't do anything about them.)<br /><br />About the video: I had to shrink it a bit in file size to upload it, but it doesn't look like the quality suffered too terribly.  Also, the date and time is wrong because I didn't set it with military time the night before.  It's twelve hours off, but I'm pretty pleased with the whole thing!<br /><br />October 9, 2015 Update:<br />I've had this dash cam for a couple months now.  I still like it, but the camera does not hold a charge at all.  If it isn't plugged in, it doesn't turn on.  And if my usb charger gets bumped or I hit a large-ish bump in the road, the camera goes off.  Both of these problems are frustrating enough that I'm taking away two stars because, in addition to these problems, there's still the issues before of the language problem (it seems to default to Chinese on occasion) and the unsharable usb cord.<br /><br />August 20, 2017 Update:<br />Okay...  I've had this thing for about two years now.  It's done it's job and finally given up the ghost.  I haven't priced batteries, but the battery wants to explode and it's having difficulty with overwriting old video footage, so I'm just going to look into a new dash cam.

Again, this is just my experience. 2) SD Card- The unit does not come with an SD card, but they can be acquired for $10-15 USD. The SD card fit into the right side of the unit. My experience has been that the SD card pushes against some sort of spring without really securing or clicking into place. I've closed the SD card door, only to have it come flying out from the unit. This has happened several times and there doesn't seem to be a remedy. 3) Instructions- The instructions make mention of an &#34;OK&#34; button.

Quality is nowhere even close to HD, so that should be removed from the misleading description, but for the price I wouldn't expect it to be. The camera comes on automatically when car is started and records continuously in 2 minute bursts. Includes a date/time stamp too. Mine appeared to have some sort of periodic glitch where every few seconds it recorded a grey bar for the bottom half of the screen but, on experimentation this appeared to be only when I was playing back directly from the SD card on my laptop, so it may be the SD card I used. When you consider this cost about the same as 2 starbilks happy-frappy-maccy-chino lattes, it is remarkable. Look at the video and see what you think ...<br /><br />Update: Having used this now for a week I have one annoying thing to report - it interferes with my Garmin Nuvi GPS so that it cannot find the satellites easily and sometimes even drops them. I have my GPS attached to the center of the windshield and this dashcam just below. When i start the car they both activate as would be expected, but now my Garmin GPS has trouble locating the satellites. I thought it was just a glitch/coincidence but if I unplug the dashcam them it can find the satellites OK. Initially this seemed to only occur on start up, but today it lost the signal twice on my 10 mile drive to work. Simply unplugging the dashcam for about 15 seconds allowed the GPS to work again, but it's hardly ideal.

I simply do not see how anyone can manufacture something like this, SHIP it, and STILL make money. Unreal. Do not let the other reviewers discourage you from buying this. I just bought this to put in my 2013 Mercedes- and I am impressed. VERY impressed. The first thing you notice is the size. It's extremely compact. Even on a small car, there's plenty of room. The menus are very intuitive, the picture is amazing- lots of options- and the angle is very wide. It will shoot the entire back wall of my garage, with the car pulled in, from about 10 feet away. So I'd say the angle is at least 120 degrees, if not more. Impressive. And when you plug it into the cigarette outlet, as long as the outlet follows the key (on/on, off/off), the little camera will beep and turn on off right along with it. Amazing. I put a 1 gig card in mine. And it works flawlessly. It will even record sound, if you want- I chose no- and you can also record a short memo, and something else I can't remember. Nice. And the included power cord is actually long enough to run the camera wire down along the A pillar without being seen. The yes, the included mount is PERFECT. Strong, light, and the angles are totally adjustable. I'm trying really hard to find a flaw- I can't. Ok, if you really want something bad, i guess the only bad thing is the display does not turn off when the screen is flipped shut. So you can see a tiny crack of light where the closure gap is.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Dash Cam itself works great, charger and USB cable that came with it don't work.", "text": "I was stunned to turn on this dash cam and find so many options. First you have the four modes of video record, picture take, sound record, and video play back.<br /><br />For most people the mode you'll use most often will be the video capture mode. This mode allows you to choose the video quality, IR LED on/off, loop record on/off, loop record time, sound recording on/off and motion sensor on/off. The most useful of these features is look record and motion sensor. It's pretty cool that the camera will record once it senses motion, theoretically you could leave it on this setting and never have to touch anything when you start driving. From what I can tell the camera also will not continue recording past the first loop until it senses motion again (when on the motion sense mode). The IR sensors on the camera do work, but they are kind of useless when using the camera as a dash cam... They aren't strong enough to see past the hood of your car, they do work however if you want to use the camera in a hallway or something. I haven't used the picture or audio recording features in depth but I can verify that they do work.<br /><br />The suction cup that came with the device is very strong. Once you click on to your windshield correctly its very hard to remove and provides for a very steady recording. I am completely satisfied with this aspect of the product.<br /><br />The two downfalls to this product (at least my product) are that neither the car charger it came with or the usb cable it came with work at all. I don't care about the USB cable since I have many of them lying around, but I did care about the car charger not working. I contacted Amazon and very quickly they gave me a partial refund to buy a replacement charger (I chose an AmazonBasics GPS charger since I knew my Garmin charger worked to charge the dash came). Since Amazon was so helpful and refunded me the money needed to replace the charger I am a happy camper once more.<br /><br />As other reviewers have said, the video quality of this dash cam is nothing special. It says it can take 720p or 1080p but I don't think that is true at all. The quality is definitely good enough to prove fault in an accident but don't expect GoPro quality video...<br /><br />Based on some of the other reviews I was stunned with what I received, everything on the device worked like a charm, and it has so many features, the device arrived with a screen protector on it, that was easily removed and it was packaged well in a surprisingly legitimate looking box with instructions in english (though they don't explain what any of the features actually do). I'm not sure if the shipped product varies greatly from shipment to shipment but I most certainly got a good quality item.<br /><br />I first tested this camera with a Class 4 4GB card that worked perfectly (recording in 2 minute loops was continuous with no lag between clips) and was able to record 44 minutes of \"720p\" video. Once I was sure I got a working device I purchased a 16GB Class 10 card which is sure to be even better.<br /><br />One final fun fact of this dash cam is that the battery used is the exact same battery used in some older Nokia phones the battery is the \"BL-5C\" [[ASIN:B0006HP7NC Nokia BL-5C Extended Li-Ion Battery]] and I am able to record about 35 minutes of \"720p\" video on a single charge.<br /><br />I paid $22 for this dash cam $11 for a 16gb SD card and Amazon refunded me enough money to buy a new charger, I could not be happier. For the great price, this dashcam is perfect, it takes good enough quality to clearly see cars, buildings, roads and people, only text is really difficult to see. If you are looking for a dash cam to use \"just in case\" you have an accident, this is definitely a great low-cost option.<br /><br />Hope it helps!<br />-J", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Znl0fg64L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Znl0fg64L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Znl0fg64L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gwTeXJobL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gwTeXJobL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gwTeXJobL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61m9Bd84cFL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61m9Bd84cFL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61m9Bd84cFL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713ICnRaq-L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713ICnRaq-L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713ICnRaq-L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SYbnwTZmL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SYbnwTZmL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SYbnwTZmL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AH7RYXFDGYQYHKLT4XHCVJ2XJ25A", "timestamp": 1364445826000, "helpful_vote": 38, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "good deal for the price", "text": "After getting past the basics of navigating the menu and settings, this seemingly toylike item does what it is advertised to do\u2014which is to record up to 720HD video through the front windshield during a drive. This opens up other possibilities as to what a device like this could be used for, but that would be beyond this brief review.<br />First off, even though this dashcam is made of plastic, it does feel sturdy (not thin, bendable plastic). I thought the mostly-plastic suction cup mount would be frail, but it also does its job rather well and there are grippable tightening rings to position the dashcam at the driver\u2019s desired angle and direction. Some \u201ccons\u201d:<br />\u2022 The power on/off and start/stop/select buttons on the back of the dashcam are totally exposed and quite sensitive. This is good when you\u2019re driving and you can turn the dashcam on and off or start recording easily, but this makes it very difficult to store the dashcam with a charged battery since the power could be turned on with the slightest nudge of the \u201con\u201d button. The manufacturers should think about adding a cap or cover over these buttons, or recessing the buttons to prevent the device from being turned on accidentally. Thankfully, the dashcam also works with the mini-USB plugged in (and the manufacturers have even included a 12V DC mini-USB car adapter cable), which also charges the battery. Speaking of the battery, it is a non-standard B5-CL 3.7V 800mah li-ion battery. Even searching Amazon, I did not find an exact match. An LG phone battery was the closest match I could find in terms of dimensions, but the positive and negative contacts are just slightly off.<br />\u2022 The IR LEDs on the front seem to work only for a short distance. In a darkened room, you can see the LEDs working on the dashcam screen when you hold your hand in front of the lens, but point the camera at the other side of the room, and it will still be dark on the screen.<br />\u2022 The image or recording cannot be flipped while viewing or recording. The tripod mount is on the top of the dashcam to allow for it to be used with the suction cup mount, and the built-in LCD screen flips down. Wouldn\u2019t this dashcam be much more useful and versatile if it could be mounted on a regular tripod or monopod, giving the user more flexibility? (I suppose you could still record upside-down if necessary and rotate images in software.)<br />In operation, the dashcam records through its wide-angle lens in continuous segments of two, five or 15 minutes until recording is turned off, and the user must preselect the segment length before recording. So a 40-minute drive with five-minute segments will have eight recordings on the SD memory card at the end of the trip. It also records sound. On an 8GB card, expect over 4-1/2 hrs. of recording capacity at VGA resolution, over three hours at D1 resolution and over two hours at 720HD resolution. The lens is tiny (about camera phone size), so don\u2019t expect overall great imagery, but the video is definitely usable and viewable.<br />You can play back on the flip-down LCD screen, or download from the memory card to view on a computer. There is even an A/V-out jack to view on a separate monitor. The LCD screen\u2019s \u201c270 degrees\u201d of movement refers to the fact that it can pivot 90 degrees to the right, and also 180 degrees to the left, so that the screen can be viewed from the front of the dashcam.<br />This device does its job without being obtrusive. Even attached to the window mount in the middle of the front windshield, very little of the driver\u2019s view is obstructed. Overall, a good deal for the price and for what it can do, though how it fares in the long run is still to be determined.", "images": [], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AEDQM236I4KV6VMJTMGMSPKNOG2Q", "timestamp": 1371417722000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

It comes with a good quality mount to attach to your windshield and if you plug it in to a switched outlet, it will turn and turn off with the car and you don't have to do anything. It has a built-in battery so you could take it from the car and use it as a camcorder, but you probably have a better one for taking movies already.<br /><br />Image quality is good, but colors are not saturated and the two highest-resolution settings the camera offers are identical. Nonetheless, it delivers good quality which is quite satisfactory for recording the traffic around you- its intended purpose.<br /><br />You don't need a big memory card to use in this device. When the card fills up, it automatically starts recycling. The oldest file gets erased and recording continues. I had an old 2gig card on hand and it works perfectly. Remember- the purpose of this thing is to record accidents and other idiots on the road. This will be in the last few minutes of the most recent recording- not something you recorded weeks ago.<br /><br />A composite video cable is included (for old TV sets) as well as an HDMI cable (for newer ones). You can play back movies right on the device. It records at night using the light from your headlights. Forget about the 6 built-in LEDs- they're useful only for hand-held recording at very close range. Night recording is what it is, and it is usable.<br /><br />For the price, this is an excellent device. Going through the menus will take a little practice. The &#34;Enter&#34; button is the red button on the back of the camera- not a button on the TFT screen.

It's that way on most, so this isn't a strong neg point, just saying.<br />3) On older vehicles and SUV's, where the power ports are active (on) all the time, the unit does not stop recording or shut off when vehicle isn't running.  I had 5 out of 5 that didn't so if you have one and it shut it self off, then congratulations.<br />4)Brackets are flimsy and several times, (clean) bracket failed to hold to front and back (clean) windshields.<br />5) Did I mention this already,...THESE DO NOT LIKE HEAT.<br /><br />Newer technology has several units that use a capacitor instead of battery.

My car has a USB port that turns off when the car is off (unlike the cigarette lighter ports which are always on), soI ended up having to use the 110V plug with a USB adapter (which didn't trigger file-transfer mode).

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Works exactly how I wanted it to work.", "text": "I must say for $15.90 this vehicle DVR is well worth the price!!! The setup was easy, the mount stays stuck to the windshield and won't fall off with vibration or heat. At first I set it at 1280x960 pixels and set it to record on motion, audio on, and overwrite memory to keep it recording if memory runs out. At first I encountered the problem that this unit freezes at the highest pixel resolution, so I set it down to 640x480 pixels. Since then, this vehicle DVR works EXACTLY how I wanted it to work. Video is good at 640x480 pixels. Having it run on battery is kind of useless since you'll never know when it shuts down because of a dead battery. So I just leave it plugged into my 12 volt plug. When I turn on my car, it powers this DVR to turn ON and there is nothing else I need to do. The DVR powers on, I start driving, and the DVR will record 2 minute clips on every motion it detects. When I park and turn off the vehicle, it cuts off the 12 volt power and I either manually turn off the DVR, or most of the time I forget to turn it off and let it run on battery  until it dies,,,but that won't affect it since it can turn back on once I start the vehicle. During daylight hours, while driving, I'll check up on the screen and usually always see it recording. Sometimes I may be driving slow on a straight road and it won't record if no vehicles are in front, but as soon as I drive close to a vehicle, motion is triggered and it starts recording. It's just a plug and play device. For the past 2 weeks I've just allowed this DVR to do it's job, then about 4 days into using it, a vehicle cut me off in front of me while driving on the freeway (no accident occurred so no big deal). When I pulled over, I checked out the option to view recordings, and sure enough, it caught the moment when that person on the BMW cut me off. No it did not get the license plate numbers, but personally,,, all I am worried about is catching an accident. Sometimes on a redlight, during the daytime, this DVR can catch license plate numbers if there is no sun glare, this DVR has even caught license plate numbers at NIGHT on a red light if there is no glare from my headlights. Overall I am happy with this vehicle DVR and would buy a 2nd one if needed. I give it 5 stars because of its good performance for the cheap price, but it DOES NOT look cheap when mounted,,. Now on the negative side: If you work as a Private Investigator and need to capture detailed events, while driving, then I do not recommend this DVR because the it won't capture much at night, and it won't capture much at a distance during the day. It is good enough to capture road rage incidents in good lighting, (if not too far away) and the audio will help out if an incident is captured at night. If you just need a cheap vehicle DVR to record accidents while driving, then I highly recommend this one. You can use the record button to push on a moment you just want to capture evidence for your records.", "images": [], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AHUSBCJ4ES6MH737HBR2WOOMOK7A", "timestamp": 1405502907000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

I inserted a 16gig card in, plugged the unit in, and once I figured out how to set the configuration I was set. The DVR turns on and off just as advertised. The video is slightly blury but more than clear enough to use in an insurance case when some idiot cuts in front of you. Some mention the display doesn't shut off. There is a setting that will shut it off by selecting a time of how long it should remain on. I set it for the minimum (I think 1 minute) and it does shut off for me. Besides, the screen folds up and can't be seen anyway. I also found the mount fairly solid. The only thing so far that I don't like are the instructions - they are pretty bad, but if you have any technical sense at all, the configuration menu, controls, and how to adjust and lock the mount are all pretty logical. If this simple and cheap DVR lasts 6 months and I have to buy another every 6 months, isn't it worth less than $50.00 a year to have video proof of fault in an accident?<br /><br />10/28/12 Update - Well the video display screen on the unit is now displaying nothing but white. This means I can't do any re-configuring at all. I have checked the SD card and the unit is still recording, turn on and off with the ignition. I'm going to continue using it until it dies but will also keep an eye out for a higher quaility unit. Considering it's doing what I want it to do and I like what it does I don't see it as a waste of money. It was a good test to see if I like it, and I do. Some people have mentioned that the video is choppy at higher resolution. I haven't found that to be the DVR itself but if the user tries to view the video with their SD card plugged into a USB adapter in a USB 1.1 port instead of a USB 2.0 or 3.0, yes, the video is choppy, but this is the port, not the actual recording. Because this unit is cheap and the display didn't last very long, I won't be purchasing another from this vendor or even this model of DVR.<br /><br />09/20/2013 Update - I should have posted this sometime back but forgot. The blank screen issue was resolved by unplugging the power and removing the battery for a few days. The unit lost all its settings when I finally got around to powering it back up. That was okay though because the screen returned. I reprogrammed the unit and it has been working perfectly ever since. There appears to be a software glitch not a hardware failure that caused the screen to go blank. Nothing that can't be worked around.

The LCD screen is not of high resolution, but it's good enough to see what you need to see. The 10 foot car lighter plug wire is long enough (in my car) to wrap around the passenger side of the windshield for an unobstructed view of the road.<br />Fortunately, the IR lights (which don't seem to be bright enough to illuminate anything more than a few feet in front) can be turned off through the menu, saving battery life and avoid camera overheating (which ruined a different IR camera I once had).<br /><br />I may have gotten an old stock unit because the battery won't hold a charge. Fortunately I found a replacement BL-5C battery and charger on Amazon for just a few bucks (worth it for me). However, this isn't a big inconvenience since the travel adapter is included. along with a USB cord. I'm pretty sure this is a &#34;cheap knockoff,&#34; but I don't mind since the price is very affordable.<br /><br />Think of it this way; if you get involved in an accident, having a dashcam may avoid you being blamed if it's the other driver's fault. You will have detailed video proof. Just take a peek at a few Russian dashcam videos to see what I mean.<br /><br />Update: After &#34;testing&#34; the dashcam on a short trip to the grocery store, I observed the results on my laptop. Even though the menu settings were for the highest definition possible, the video playback seemed very grainy and choppy. This was on an overcast day late in the afternoon, so that may have something to do with it. I'll continue to test this dashcam in bright daylight and in night conditions.<br />Again, for the price I wasn't expecting a lot, but it does work well.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610VmTYzEyL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610VmTYzEyL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/610VmTYzEyL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AF3FQ6QSMVJQHO27ZAOONQFHAWCQ", "timestamp": 1433616419000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

There is very little vibration coming through the mount to distort the video. I use the 640x480 size because it will be the most stable and smallest file size. Basically it does exactly what I expected it to do and the price cannot be beat. I previously had purchased a mount so I could use my Flip video recorder but that was a hassle.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Worth the money", "text": "[[VIDEOID:1efec5fceb524ff6df91ff822c35d33b]] I'm on day 8 of this camera and really couldn't be happier with it for the price.  It's not 1080 or even 720, the best resolution is the VGA setting which is only just \"good\" quality when used during daylight hours.  The night vision is poor but if there was an incident I believe the camera would capture enough evidence to hold up in court or with an insurance company.<br /><br />Here's my impressions:<br /><br />1. The camera housing is cheaply made<br />2. The mount is cheap but the locking suction cup works very well.  As some of the other reviewers mentioned get the camera mount set up once, don't figit with the mount repeatedly or the poor quality plastic will strip out and fail.  Get it right once and just leave it.<br />3. I was worried about large gaps between clips.  I am using a sandisk 16G Ultra class 10 card.  I formated it in the camera and am doing 5 minute clips.  There is a little less then 1 second gap betwean clips.<br />4. IR LED's work but dont do any good while driving.  I just disabled them in the menu.<br />5. Even during daylight hours you wont be able to read license plates or street signs (you can make out stop signs.) So if you're looking for a cam that can get that detailed you might want to consider another option.<br />6. The power cord was long enough to run under the dash, up the window pillar and under the headliner so I could discretely mount the camer in front of my rear view mirror.  I think it's about 10 feet long.<br />7. Video playback can be done on the camera or you can pop out the sd card and copy the videos to your PC.  No need to use a third party app to convert the files like some other dash cams.<br />8. Audio is kind of a bit off.  It captures everything well but it makes voices have a higher pitch then normal.<br /><br />Overall I'm pleased with this camera and it does what I need it to for the price. I went ahead ordered another one yesterday for my wifes car after testing this one out for a few days.<br /><br />My only worry now is how long it will last.

The lenses can be VERY different, and mine is perhaps a 50mm lens equivalent on a camera, not at ALL 120 degree angle. Even my standard iPhone 5S has a much wider (and 100x clearer) image than this. Also the lens is pretty crappy (uploading pics and video) and the resolution quality is even more horrid. Granted it is a crap shoot buying this as it seems the manufacturer has probably 6 or even more different places that assemble these. The menus are different, image quality and frame rate are (as I've compared mine with others and mine is the far cheaper version). The unit was set onto FHD 1080p, but two painful realities: It only recorded in 720p (half the size), and the image quality was SO BAD, that I could barely read license plate on vehicles in front of me.<br /><br />Thinking that perhaps the VGA setting might yield a wider image, I attempted that setting, however there was zero change in field of recording view. One can take still images, but they are absolutely no better, and the size is so paltry, what's the point? (I will add images from this and comparing iPhone image too). You're really gambling with the parent company that designed these. My suggestion? Look at the good vs bad reviews. If the good numbers outweigh the bad, that's your chance of getting a winner. However, if (like this camera) the reviews are far more worse than better (34pct of 1-star reviews vs 24pct of 5-star postings as of mine), you'll more likely get a unit that you won't be pleased with. I'd like to just throw mine on a trash heap, but I'll just return it this week.<br /><br />I will attempt to upload the uncompressed images and clips, but they already look bad now, and I wonder how they will look when Amazon compresses them?

It's one of the few times I received something like this in a ziploc bag (with the DVR in a bubble wrap). Construction is cheap, and although the instructions described an A/V cable, there isn't one in the package. I wasn't planning on connecting this directly to a TV, so I didn't follow up on that.<br /><br />What's included is the DVR, the lithium ion battery, the suction cup mount, a piece of instruction leaflet (English, Chinese and Russian), the car power adapter (very long cord - can be routed to keep it out of the way) and a mini USB cable. You need to open one of the flaps on the side to plug in the USB power cable. The other flap on the opposite side covers the SD card slot.<br /><br />The screen is protected by a sheet of plastic. Removing it was a pain, but take your time so that you don't damage the LCD. The LCD is useful for helping aim the camera, and for settings, but unusable in bright sunlight even inside the car. I went through the menu settings. They're pretty much self explanatory, which is good because the instruction leaflet was no help. You need to supply a full sized SD card. I used a 32 GB card without any problem.<br /><br />There is a 1920x1080 setting for video. When I chose that, it recorded in 1280x720 (NOT 1080p), but at slightly above 30 fps. At the 1280x720 setting, it recorded at just slightly above 29.97 fps.<br /><br />Encoding format is motion JPEG. Video quality is mediocre. Don't count on being able to read license plates, but you can definitely tell what you're seeing. IR, as most people pointed out, is useless, and you can leave it off.<br /><br />Using it is simple. Leave it plugged in. When the car turns on, it powers up the unit which starts recording. When you turn the car off, the unit records for another few seconds, then powers off. Files are 2 mins in length, configurable for longer lengths. Default is to erase older files when the card is full.<br /><br />At just a bit over $20, it's a good DVR to play around with. Probably good enough for insurance purposes, though I'm not sure if it can be used as evidence in court. My guess is that it would probably be good enough to prove your innocence (or at least cast reasonable doubt), but not enough to get someone else convicted.

I have a [[ASIN:B001ECQVTM Transcend 16 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC6E]] in this thing. I find it records longer using 480P than the 720P setting. And as you can see in the video, there isn't that much of a difference. The first sequence is 480p and the second sequence is 720p.<br /><br />As you can see, the video looks a little washed out. I haven't found in-camera settings to adjust this yet. It may be because the IR lights are on.<br /><br />I don't have any recent night time driving video, but the IR lights work okay. They don't illuminate much more than what your headlights do. You're better off just keeping them turned off to use less power. The date and time functions work nicely and imprint on the video. It keeps time well. The internal battery lasts quite a while.<br /><br />This camera has earned the nickname \"Disco-Magic\" from my fiance due to the sound it plays when it turns off and on.

(cons same as what others reported)<br /><br />- When it did work, video was not great, reasonable on 640 mode.<br />- Instructions are of no value, but with menu button experimentation, you'll see how it works.<br />- 2/5/10 min loop does not work.  (only once where i saw it loop at 2min)<br />- &#34;HD&#34; does not work.  Might as well leave it in 640 mode to save disk space.<br />- 90% of the time, playback is very choppy.  (also reported by reviewer &#34;Manx&#34;)<br />- Recording corrupts the SD card.  (this is the cause of choppy playback.)  Takes 30 min to copy a 50MB file from SD card to laptop.  Have to reformat under windows to get the card to work again.  (fyi: card works fine with my Sony camera and copies very fast between Sony camera and laptop)<br />- Locks up on many occasions. Had to remove battery/power.<br />- IR does not seem to have any effect.  Recorded during nite, but playback showed dark video.  (headlights helped more)<br />- Bright / sunny day and driving into sun causes recorded video to be &#34;foggy/snow blizzard&#34;.  - maybe direct sunlight too much for weak lens<br />- Product appeared used when I got it.<br /><br />Overall, product not reliable and does not work as advertised.

If you want HD picture, GPS, & G-forge readings there are plenty of OTHER options but they will be hundreds. I see this camera as something that will provide non-bias evidence if ever needed to defend myself.<br /><br />It IS low resolution, but not close to a deal breaker. It reminds me of the quality of digital video cameras 5  or so years back as far as picture quality is concerned.<br /><br />The on-board LCD really should only be used for aiming the camera to the car's center. Other than that the LCD is very low quality. Once you remove the video from the card, it looks mush better than on the LCD. I am able to make out clearly the license plates in front of me for one car length, out of that it is too pixelated, but still shows a good view of what is going on. There is also a digital zoom if you need to get a little closer, albeit lower resolution, to your subject while driving.<br /><br />You CAN turn off sound which I thought helped and saved space on the SD card. The IR should also be turned off due to at night it reflects off the window back to the camera. It can be turned on again if you need to take the camera out to record outside damage without a light source.<br /><br />Night vision (IR Off) is lacking. You would still be able to use it in court to show how the other cars moved, but you couldn't use it to ID people or plates.<br /><br />Battery lasts a couple hours but I just keep mine plugged in because the charging cable they sent is LONG. It wrapped from the review mirror (Where my camera is), around the frame of the windshield, down the door, under the carpet, under the chair, and into the center console (2004 Toyota Camry).<br /><br />Mount is EXCELLENT, the most solid part of the package; never moves aim or loses suction.<br /><br />Case of camera is medium-grade plastic and seems to hold together well, not too bad by any means.<br /><br />Overall: I will be getting another for the second car. Happy with purchase.<br /><br />1 YEAR UPDATE:<br />The camera is still running just as it did when I first set it up. The only thing that broke was the most solid part of the item... the mount. The suction ring came off of the mount so I could not attach it to the window. It has a standard camera mount screw so finding a replacement was not hard. My overall opinion of the product has not changed: It is a GREAT camera for the amount you have to pay! Video is not great, but it will hold up in court if you needed it (Which is why most of you are getting it anyways). It was HARD to set up but once that is done, it works forever.

It doesn't see license plates clearly but there's sound so you can read the plate & it will be recorded. I bought it as accident insurance. If someone abruptly cuts into your lane & you hit them, you're automatically at fault because you failed to stop. The offending driver will lie and say they were in front of you all along but you were driving too fast/ tailgating/ etc... I haven't had an incident where I could test this (thankfully). It seems reasonable to assume that if you tell the officer you have a dash camera that will show the driver swerve into your lane leaving you no room to respond, it will be evidence against the other driver. Once the driver is informed of your evidence, they may admit their action to avoid police action against them. I think your insurance company would like that sort of evidence too. It also shows traffic lights. If you're pulled over for running a red light when it was yellow, the video will show the light color as you passed through the intersection. The night vision isn't good. You get a general view of the road. It's not a security camera. If a person is in the range of the camera, you can see them. If it's a car, you won't get a plate#. If you're hit by junk flying out of a truck, you can read off the plate#. You must use the power cord. The battery doesn't last more than about 20 min. The directions aren't good. You have to play with it to set the date, etc... The default settings are fine for video recording. You can take still pics but I don't see any reason for that.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Seriously Adequate and a Great Value", "text": "News Update:<br />* The Hi-Rez video works with a Lexar Platinum II SDHC UHS-1 16 GB card. That's a class 10 card. My class 4 would not shoot in hi-rez. I can now make out license plates at medium/close distances.<br />* The OK button is on the main unit, not with the other menu buttons.<br />* Files are AVI format and will open in the free Quicktime viewer on my Mac. They can be converted from there.<br />* Hi-Rez settings run about 38MB a minute. That's about 20 minutes a Gigabyte. That's about 5.3 hours before rollover.<br />* There is no time gap when it starts the new video (confirmed in hi-rez setting)<br />* I'm now exceptionally pleased with the unit given the price.<br /><br />The other reviewer who wrote the Cliff Notes Instructions really tipped me over the edge; it obviously works for him. I think the toughest thing to realize is that the OK button is not with the other menu buttons; it's on the main unit instead. Once you get that, it's pretty easy to navigate the menus. I was surprised that it included a cell-phone-like battery for the price. You will need to buy a card but I had one laying around that I used (but it wasn't fast enough for the hi-rez setting).<br /><br />It's ready to roll and the factory default is the least resolution setting. The date/time will need to be set also. However, to use it, you can just stick it on the window and plug it in and you're up and running fully protected. I like the little flip down screen too. One enhancement I'd like to see is a cross hairs that extends all the way across because it would make it a little easier to line it up perfectly with the horizon. Otherwise, the little reticle works good.<br /><br />I checked it really carefully and the videos transition without any gaps. Sound is not great but you can make out words, hear turn signals clicking, and hear most road sounds. I'd say the audio is somewhat poor resolution but that's not really a major concern. It also rolls over automatically. One thing that I'm not sure about still is how to mark a video so it isn't overwritten? I don't think it has this feature.<br /><br />Video at night was just OK but not great in the low rez setting.<br /><br />The real point is that at this price, you really have no excuse to wait if you're a first timer. Even if you graduate to a better one that's got HD and high resolution sound, this one could still be great to have for the rear window or even monitoring the cars interior (think teenaged drivers or fleet vehicles).<br /><br />Bottom Line: Don't wait any longer. For $23.95 including shipping, there's no reason not to get one.<br /><br />Addendum:<br />I had my first event three days after I got it!

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Really good camera. It works.", "text": "I use this camera for driving and as a dashboard cam. Before I get into this review, let me say what I flat out like about this camera:<br /><br />1) The video goes in a loop once the memory card is full. So I have a 16GB card, and this records about 3-5 hours of video on it. Once that 3-5 hours is used, it goes back to the start and starts recording from the oldest point. You can still see the most recently recorded video whenever you want.. I use it on my car. This is the main feature I love since I don't have to do anything and I don't have to worry about the memory card getting full and me having to delete it or potentially not record when I need it to. There is a setting on the setup to make it so that when the card gets full, it doesn't overwrite the oldest point to record again. I have no need for that and want it to record in a loop.<br /><br />2) I can plug it into my power supply and when I unplug it the camera turns off. Also when you plug it in, it automatically starts recording without touching or pressing anything. The only time you need to press the record button is the initial point. This makes getting in and out of the car a breeze. So I plug it in when I drive, then I unplug it when I get home. Super easy and nothing need to be messed with. When I'm at a store I can still have it plugged in and record in case.<br /><br />3) Good quality videos.  I live in a city so at night it's bright enough to see everything in front of me. Not super clear but good enough to see at least what needs to be seen which is right in front of your car as well as any sort of signs and lights.<br /><br />Now for things I don't like:<br /><br />1) Ultra cheap plastic piece of junk. I mean literally a piece of junk plastic is what this is. It comes with a mount and I broke it one day just by touching it. As such, the way it's hanged on my car is by a bungee cord wrapped around the rear view mirror. Not pretty but it works. This can be a pro as well since if someone breaks into your car, you only lose a cheap camera that can easily be replaced.<br /><br />2) You can't replay the video on the camera itself (or at least not that I can figure out). You have to remove the card and play it on a computer. I found this to be a major issue especially if you need to see the video right away for whatever reason.<br /><br />3) Videos are segmented to 3 minutes. So even if the card is capable of storing 90 minutes, each video file is 3 minutes in length. So if something happened, chances are it's spread across in files. You'd have to use a video software of some type to combine the videos into one continuous video.<br /><br />4) A couple of times the camera went all crazy. I mean it froze and either didn't turn off when I unplugged it or I would plug it in and it would freeze. I would have to unplug everything and take out the battery. This only happened about three times for me. It's very rare for it to happen.<br /><br />5) I have no idea on the battery life of this thing. So I can't really comment on that. However, for my purpose, I only need it powered while I'm in the car.<br /><br />I have five of these cameras each with 16gb cards. I had it for about a year or so now and I love it and use it everyday. To date, it hasn't failed me yet other than the cheap plastic mount breaking.<br /><br />Now for story time. One day while driving to the store for lunch, I was waiting for a left turn. The light turned green and I turned left as well as the person across the street turned left since we both had the green light. Unknowing to the driver across me, the person next to me went forward as well but had the red light. The two cars collided and with a loud bang. Knowing I had video evidence of me having green light, and the forward light was red, I decided to talk to the officer at the scene of the accident. Not really for being a &#34;good samaritan&#34; but more like I wanted to test if these videos would hold any merit. The police officer on scene told me both people said they had the green light, and I explained I had a dash video that might show that I had the green light, and the light was red. He agreed to watch the video and we got in my car and tried to look at it. We found that you couldn't play it back on the camera itself. So I told him I was going back to my office and that I could email him the video. He agreed and he gave me his card.<br /><br />I went back to my office and got the video off the memory stick and emailed it to the officer. The video was clear as day. It showed the car next to me clearly, and showed that I had the green light, and the forward light was red. It also clearly showed all cars involved. Even though it didn't show the actual accident, you can clearly make out each car moments before the accident and exactly who had the red light or green light. I explained to the officer this and he saw the video. He loved it and said he would show the judge the video and would charge the woman who ran the red light. He said I might have to show up to court to explain that I had the video. He also said I had to turn in the original file to him and I agreed. All said and done, the person pleaded guilty to running the red light merely from the fact that the video was there and I didn't even need to show up.<br /><br />In conclusion, YES this camera system does work. While I didn't experience an actual accident, I indirectly helped someone else from being falsely accused of running or not running a light. Since nobody else was there to help or be a witness, this video did just that for them.<br /><br />I can definitely say that while this camera is poorly constructed, it does work. I live in a area that has four seasons and it can get ice cold at night during winter months. Since I only had this camera through one winter, it still works.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "For the money, it's a decent device", "text": "People who criticize this for not doing a stellar job just isn't using common sense.  For goodness sake look at how much you're paying for it.  There are far better DVRs out there but you have to multiply what you payed for with this by a factor of 20.  Don't buy a Hyundai and complain that it doesn't work anything like a Bentley.<br /><br />Anyways, I've only had the device for less than a day and all I can say is that it's \"ok\".  The video is pretty poor for night driving, which is what I mainly use it for.  I'm sure if I fiddled with the settings a little more it can improve.  I was surprised to find that it comes with a battery.  That would be helpful just in case the power source gets cut and you may have a corrupt video file that's unusable.<br /><br />The screen is also helpful to correctly position the camera.  I've seen others complain about the viewing angle but I find it acceptable.  I can see about half way in each lane from the hood of my car.  To me that's fine.  Again considering how much this device cost.<br /><br />It was also nice that it comes with an a/c charger.  Although I would probably keep this in my car 99.5% of the time.<br /><br />I've seen others complain about the poorly written manual.  The menu system on this device is pretty self explanatory.  Anyone with experience of portable electronics the past 20 years should get this in about 5 minutes.  It's easy.  The record button is what you would use to make a selection.  Up/Down... well up down!  Menu button allows you to alter device and recording settings.  Mode allows you to switch between camera, video camera and picture/video viewer.<br /><br />One thing about the device is that it's very cheaply made.  But what do you expect for the same price you pay for a movie ticket and a small popcorn and soda?  I've yet to test it in daylight.  I will do so later and update this review.<br /><br />What I really like about it is the device starts recording right away as soon as power is sent thru the cigarette lighter.  It also has a blinking light so you know that its recording without having to keep the screen open.  With the mount and the screen open, it covers a good part of your windshield so be prepared to be cited by a cop, depending where you live.  I had to mount it to the right of my rear view mirror to not obstruct my view with the screen open.  Also, since most new cars have a dot matrix shade above the windshield, I had to mount it lower since the suction device will not work on the dot matrix surface.<br /><br />Really, as long as the device works, for what you pay for... it's really outstanding.  You want better low light shooting, smaller form factor, better resolution, a better device overall?  PAY UP!<br /><br />----------update--------------<br />Like I expected, the night time shooting is pretty bad.  All you can see are blurry lights of other cars.  The focus isn't as good.<br /><br />Day time performance was decent as well.  You can see the street and cars clearly even though you may not be able to read their plates.  All that matters is that it will capture the moment someone (knock on wood) crashes into you.<br /><br />Another negative I found is that the USB performance of transferring files thru the camera is it's painfully slow.  I have a feeling it's USB 1.0  That's right!  So you're better off pulling out the memory card and using a media reader connected to a computer instead of going through the unit.<br /><br />I have tested the first unit and will test the other one tomorrow.  When everything works fine, I will place them in both cars.<br /><br />Bottom line:  For the money, they're not too bad.", "images": [], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AFKFETPGPRA7PA6IEN4AOFVMBARQ", "timestamp": 1366293639000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

It works well for that as well.<br />My car does not supply power to the cigarette lighter automatically with the key or turn the power off when the key is switched off, so I just plug it in when beginning a drive and try to remember to unplug the cam when ending the drive.

Nice and sensitive. It will just keep going. One thing to note is that once the feature is turned on. Nothing seems to work until the device is restarted. I'm sure there is a timer. I left it outside for a short while. It gets a great pictures. Let's you adjust the line frequency. Tons of menu options. This device is fun to play with. You can use it just about anywhere. Super long cord on the DC vehicle adapter. You could have plenty of extension to run it under your dash or wherever. The package was put together nicely and everything looked brand new and properly sealed. Very impressed. I almost left a negative review because I did not realize that the IR Led function is turned on using one quick press of the power button. Viola! It's also flawless the night vision I love it. This thing goes above and beyond a car dash cam and I wish the peephole DVR we ordered had as many options and as good of picture quality and motion detection that this $15 dollar device has.<br /><br />The only draw back I can see thus far is having no option in the menu to choose any option other than 10 minutes for the recording intervals. The motion detection recorded 10:02 before quitting and then picked up something else about 4 minutes before I picked it back up and brought it inside. If you park your car anywhere there isn't going to be motion all the time you could spot vandals with this thing. My peephole DVR takes the same batteries (from old samsung or simillar flip phones) so I have a few of the and O am going to order some more. Love this device, love the person who programmed the OS and the idea is awesome. Better than a cheap radar detector.<br /><br />One more thing about this camera. It has a GIANT original SD card. I had to use an adapter for the 32GB Micro SD card I had on hand.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Did some research the second time around. (Update Feb 14th 2014)", "text": "I read almost all the reviews on Amazon. I had not done any other research at the time, but decided to take a chance and purchase. I recived the unit. It takes video that looks OK, but would not record audio at all. There is a marking in the plastic for an HDMI port but the hole is not cut out. The display screen has a mark on it that was there when i bought it and will not come off. The battery door is not a door and is not removable like in one Amazon reviewers video here. I need audio because if i was in an accident the camera may not be able to make out the plate and i would have to call it out to the camera if i was able.<br /><br />So before i bought a new one to replace this one i did as much research as i could. I did not know this at first but it turns out that these cameras are really Standard Definition versions (even though the box claims otherwise) of what is called a DVR-027. They look the same from the outside, but have some noticeable differences.<br /><br />You will see even in Amazon reviews here that the date stamp numbers are green or yellow to the left or right. a real HD DVR-027 has its date stamp top center and is stamped Black on a white background. The quality looks better. it has real HD there is only an HDMI port and no A/V out. This one on Amazon is not horrible for the price. Real DVR-027s go for about 60 dollars. If you are in a bit of a hurry and don't mind the not as good video quality this camera is OK, but if you are really concerned about making sure that the camera will have your back in case something does happen i would suggest doing as much research as you can use Google and YouTube and pick up a real in HD DVR-027<br /><br />Valentine's Day 2014 Update<br /><br />It has been over a year since my purchase of this device as well as my real DVR-027.<br />DashCamera technology has made great progress since then. At this point in time after over a year of research my honest advice would be to not buy this or any other camera cheaper then what is called a G1W witch can be found on Amazon here [[ASIN:B00FONBG1A G1W 1080P DashCam]]/[[ASIN:B00HMNFWYW G1W-H 1080P DashCam Wider View and all black casing]]<br /><br />Like in the past with the DVR-027 you need to be careful of SD versions of the G1W. Make sure to get one with the Novatek 96650 chip and NOT the Novatek 96620 chip.<br /><br />I keep reading people saying things like does an okay job for 20 dollars or don't mind the low quality of these cameras, but lets take a second and think about it. for only a little bit more money isn't it worth the peace of mind that higher quality video and a more reliable camera bring? A better day time video. A better night time video. A better chance to catch the plate of or features of a car who hit you and run off or bumped your car while it was parked.<br /><br />I would want every driver to do the research. Visit places like DashCamTalk read what other drivers who use different models are saying and decide on a good quality camera that fits your needs.<br /><br />Weather you drive a Corvette or a Camry your car, family, and yourself should always be protected, and a good camera will have your back day and night the next time someone tries to brake check you because they are in a bad mood. It happens all over USA, UK, AUS, and every other country.

My purpose for the device is to just record driving in case something happens, I'm not concerned with license plate info at this stage just being able to re-create an incident should one occur.  I will update rating as I continue to use it.  I selected fair due to the difficulty I had in figuring it out and the quality of the materials (as a note to quality - I'm ok with the construction due to price but to be fair it does feel cheaply constructed).<br /><br />Another important thing to note from the instructions, it takes a few uses (full battery depletion followed by 12 hour charge to get full battery capacity).  I'm not there yet so don't know if this is true.  Right now full charge shows as 3/4.<br /><br />Update after 3 uses:  So, I've finally been able to use the camera (after formatting).  so far I've discovered when I power the device off it doesn't actually power off.  I purchased this to be a camera for recording driving in case of an incident.  Used to get to work (work fine).  Stopped recording when I got to work, turned power off.  When I got back to my car 8 hours later the battery was dead.  Apparently it didn't turn off (3 days in a row).  Today I verified I had turned it off...next i will actually take battery out to see if that does the trick (not how it should work).<br /><br />For the price paid this device so far does work well....and I call attention to the comment for the price paid.

From there the experience changed.  The instructions were kinda lame but with all the online reviews and videos I was able to get it to function sometime.  First I charged the battery and formatted a 16gb memory card using the camera so as to have the correct format.  During this whole process it froze up a few times but being new to the functions, I thought it may just be me doing something wrong.  I was able to take a few short (5- 30 sec.) clips in the house using the battery but that was about it.  Decided to install it in the car to give it a fair chance.  Ran the power cable around the windshield and mounted it just behind the mirror.  Started the car and it came on and started recording then stopped and froze up.  Removed the battery, reset the settings and repeated the process but started driving.  Everything seemed to be working this time but then 2 blocks down the street, froze again.  When I say froze, that is what I mean.  The picture still displays but the recording stops and it will not respond to any buttons.  The only thing you can do is remove the battery to get it to clear and then all your presets are erased and must be reinstalled if you want date, time, video mode, duration, etc. etc..  I removed it and returned it as soon as I got back home.  I did view the video and it was ok but very short.

The camera does work and is, as others have said, good for evidence should you involved in a collision, and likewise the recording isn't bad should you need in case of a law enforcement interaction, but that's where it stops.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-GREAT price compared to other similar items on the market.<br />-Automatic on and off once you get set up you can forget it<br />-Constant recording and overwriting of old videos once SD card is full.<br />-Window suction cup is amazing. Other makers of window mounting suction cups could learn a thing or two from these guys. I've never had one that sticks as well as this. When adjusting I almost couldn't get it back off with the pressure clip open!!! Amazing. I could believe being in a collision and this thing not letting go.<br />-Interface and directions aren't great but pretty straight forward<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Constructions is VERY cheap.<br />-When mine arrived the camera lens was pushed into the device at an angle, but fortunately I was easily able to pop it back out so it was usable.<br />-Overall design is lacking decent functionality in that the doors for the SD card are not easy to open at all. The IR leds are a bit of a joke as they don't aid whatsoever with night vision, so hopefully if you have an incident at night, you are in a well lit area.<br />-640x480 is the only actual resolution, the others are not accurate and software based.

You will NOT get clear tag numbers and forget about night vision. For the money it does as I had expected it to. I installed a 16GB memory card and played with the settings a little bit. It works well on the laptop as far as vision but again the tag numbers aren't as clear. For home security I back my vehicle in my driveway where I've installed motion activated lights myself. It sees any vehicles clearly  and even human faces (my own and blind tests with friends visiting). I'm not so concerned with this being my primary home security camera as I already have 8 Hi res and night vision cameras at home but was just curious. I notified my insurance company of installation but they did would not reduce my insurance rates due to our state's voyeurism laws (SC residents must have party notifications/permissions to use audio or video devices during recordings). The mount is somewhat secure and doesn't rattle too much but the &#34;screw in mount&#34; for the camera does have a little bit of free play but not enough to jar the videos during driving. The only time video rattle became an annoyance was during an off roading excursion I'd taken but nearly any camera that does not have a suspension style mount will have the same problem.<br /><br />Pro: It captures real time movements of vehicles in front of you and what is going on within it's field of view.

I researched it and its b/c its a knock off of a higher quality camera that has none of the problems the cheaper ones do.  Also, it only records in one minute segments in motion detection mode.  Problem being is it takes a second or two to switch files between minutes.  So you miss 1/60 or 1/30 of total time switching.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Hard to be upset for such a great price.", "text": "I mean, for this price, how could I get upset? Everything but the memory is included in the package. The camera works just as expected, picture quality is adjustable but sacrifices storage space as expected. I've viewed video from night and day drives and it shows up phenomenally! I even captured my entire encounter with a stranded drunk driver who needed a jump which turned into me giving him a lift to a local bar. Audio quality is perfect for picking up any and every sound you need to hear, and the image is great! I can't complain getting all this in this very inexpensive package.<br /><br />I've had it for a year or two now and here are some of the cons I've noticed. When you first set everything up the whole menu and everything is in Chinese or something so you have to click and guess how to change it to English, I got lucky! Also over time the battery (much like a phone battery) doesn't hold charge very well anymore mostly because it's best to always keep it plugged in anyway which seems to be constantly charging the battery... bad setup. It does turn on/off automatically but if you don't have outlets in your car that activate with startup/shut down of the car then you have to manually hold down the button and listen for a beep to say it's off. Lately it's been taking a long time to confirm it is on. Also it has dropped off the windshield once and every since then the screen doesn't stay in the fully up position, it's always slightly open, really annoying at night because you can see the light of the screen in the opening and with my top down, it's really noticeable at a distance. Another big downfall for me is that in order to mount it to the top of a windshield hanging down maximizing inconspicuousness and being out of the way of anything else including visibility (which is impossible considering how much space it takes up with all the linkages) you can only screw it down by about one thread which poses a threat of falling down all the time. If you bought it and tried mounting it this way you'll see exactly what I'm saying but the camera itself mounts onto a coarse thread and there's a locking nut above that to keep it tight. Great for other positions but certainly without that locking nut I would not be able to mount this in my car unless I block some of my vision. Not an option considering my car has such limited windshield as it is. Also if you leave it on for too long, like several days, it will get jammed up and stops recording causing you to have to disconnect all power from the unit to get it to function properly again.<br /><br />Like I said, for the price, this is all very easy to look past, I've had it for about 2 years I think and it still does the job very well. I've caught some funny stuff on this thing and idiot drivers more than anything. Thankfully no accidents, but I know it's there just in case. Gonna upgrade to a $100 unit now that I've got the feel for owning such a thing and love it! If you're wondering if you should spend your money on it, YES! You will not consider this a waste of money I promise you that (granted you get one that's not a dud) unless you had a higher end model and are considering this. This is for beginners, first-timers, just trying it out. You'll love it if you're just checking out the idea of having a dash-cam.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Completely useless", "text": "The listing for this product puts 5 completely different products in one.  I can only assume they do this so the reviews for the better quality items boost the average rating of the poorer quality items.  In either case:<br /><br />This review is for the &#34;2.5-inch&#34; camer<br /><br />First the physical review:<br />- The mount the camera comes actually is pretty decent.  It has a good quality suction cup, and it allows a pretty decent range of articulation.  It would be nice if it were a bit smaller (to take up less windshield real estate), and the clamps do tend to loosen over time (allowing the camera to move), but in general I'm pretty happy with the mount.<br />- The screen is all but useless.  In daylight it's much too dim to see, and at night the video is too dark to see anything.  On top of that, mine had some type of quality-control stamp right on the screen itself.<br />- The charger has a decent length cord, but it requires you to open a &#34;door&#34; on the camera to plug it in - making it look very &#34;untidy&#34; on your windshield.  This door could probably be ripped off, but a usb cord with a 90* plug would be needed to avoid having the cable sticking a few inches out from the unit.<br /><br />As for the video quality:<br />- It does have a 720p mode... and while it may be 720p video, it's of such poor quality that you could never read a license plate number or anything from the video.<br />- The video seems to particularly struggle with capturing movement (it blurs movement)... which is particularly annoying in a camera that is mounted to a moving vehicle<br /><br />As for the functionality:<br />- Here is where the camera is all but useless.  It &#34;crashes&#34; frequently (about 1 in every 3 trips), which then requires a hard-reset (remove battery & unplug usb), and also corrupts the memory card.  This also resets all the settings to the defaults - so if you plan on using this as a &#34;set it and forget it&#34;.... forget it.  It takes about 3 minutes to reset all the settings each time, so if you really want to use it, you'll need to spend about 3 minutes prior to any trip setting up the camera.<br />- The default video length is 20 seconds, but it takes about 10 seconds for it to write the file... so you only catch about 2/3rds of the action anyways.  You can configure this to up to 15 minutes/video (highly recommended), but it doesn't save this setting through &#34;crashes&#34;, so you have to reset it every trip.<br />- The default quality is 240i/PAL.  You'll want to change it to 720p/NTSC, but again you need to set this after every &#34;crash&#34;<br />- The time/date is useless since it resets every trip to 1/1/2011<br />- The charger back-draws power from the unit's onboard battery, so if you unplug the charger but leave it plugged into the camera, it will drain the camera's battery.  You need to unplug the charger from both the cigarette lighter and the usb port on the camera every trip.<br /><br />In a week of using the camera before returning it, I used it for about 400 minutes of driving over a total of 20 trips.  All told I ended up with about 20 minutes of decent usable video, or about 5% of what I should've gotten.  If you're hoping to catch something interesting on camera, you better hope it happens in that 5% of the time it's working.", "images": [], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AGKJ2PMT5GQOWRCAXUEZEFFEIYPA", "timestamp": 1401898261000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "2.5 HD Dash Video Cam - 270 whirl", "text": "I purchased this cam at Amazon and standard shipping was free. (That's always a plus)! I received this item & it was packaged excellent & was able to plug it into my car and use it right away. You will need to either run it in your vehicle or plug it into the computer with the cable that comes with it to charge the battery. Some have suggested that the menu is not an easy one but I didn't have any problems with it at all. Mine also came set to English. I am very impressed with the daytime picture. Exactly what I would expect and it is easy to set up and attach to the windshield of my car. I'm not real crazy about the way you have to unscrew it when you stop somewhere and need to take it off to take it with you. Just a bit ackward but a more expensive cam may have a release button. I'm not really complaining, I can live with it. The night video, after it gets really dark is nothing to brag about. If you are in a city setting, or in a well lit area it makes a little difference but on a country road you can barely see beyond the hood of your car. However, let me put it this way, I don't do a lot of nighttime driving and even so if something happened you would probably be seeing enough to record what happened. If you do a lot of night driving you might want to look around & ck to see if more money means better night recording. The first day I used it I recorded 2 different cars pull into traffic and barely miss other cars right in front of me. It has a picture mode also, not great pictures but would suffice if needed to take pictures of something. It doesn't come with a SD/MMC card, & it does state that, but you can pick them up pretty reasonable if you don't have any. I use 2 so that I can have a spare if I want to save something on the first one until I get to my computer to take it off. If you film something you want to save you can take it from the card to your computer. It is not a heavy piece of equip. & it's easy to carry with you when you leave the vehicle. You don't get much as far as an instruction booklet but I found it was enough. While driving it is not a distraction. I would certainly recommend this little cam to anyone who drives.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Can't beat the price!", "text": "The GOOD...<br />The price... can't beat it for under $20.  Sure, it likely isn't HD and it isn't as wide a view as a higher priced model.  Just remember you get what you pay for.  I wanted something to throw in my company vehicle to record in a 10min loop in case something happened.  It does that just fine. I love the way it starts recording automatically when it is plugged in and shuts down when unplugged.  I'm very happy with this item!<br />The BAD....<br />My unit arrived with a battery that would not hold a charge. So, every time it powered down it lost the date/time. This was very annoying.  I'm an electronics's guy so I had a similar battery laying around that was good and I soldered it in permanently instead of tying to buy one that fit perfect. Now it works super.<br />I haven't even bothered to use the night vision LED's.  I would assume they would be good for only a short distance and likely glare off the windshield. At night it does pick up the headlights so it does work to some extent at night... again, good enough for me.<br />I used mine set to 10 min files. So, every 10 min it creates a new file.  Eventually the memory fills up and it starts overwriting the oldest file.  This is not an issue, just know that if you have something happen and you stop recording to save it, be sure to get into the files and PROTECT the file you want to keep so it does not get overwritten.<br />Another annoying aspect is the mount... to use in multiple cars I made a second mount but it still has to be unscrewed when moving vehicle to vehicle. It could be moved with the mount but then it would need adjusting each time.  The only thing I would look for in an upgraded or different model is to get one with a snap in mount/cradle.

I then received a letter from the other driver's insurance company that they may be making a claim against me.  I called the adjuster, mentioned I had a dash cam showing the incident, and the other driver at fault.  After their review of the video, they today made an offer to pay for my vehicle.

One is to use external power through the 12V-5V cigarette-lighter to mini-USB cable.  The camera should power on with the car, start recording, and stop when the car shuts off.  What really happens is the camera powers on, but does not start recording.  Pressing the REC button gets a beep, but no recording.<br /><br />Manual mode means while on car or battery (which came fully charged) power press the REC button.

Just plug it in your car, when you start up it starts recording, when you turn it off it stops. If you want to see the videos, use the included USB cable and plug it in your PC, default is it looks like flash drive (it's also supposed to support PC camera mode, I didn't try that).<br /><br />If you want to use it as a manually controlled video camera, still camera, audio recorder, and playback for all those, you'll have to get used to the user interface.<br /><br />I suggest use USB card optimized for video, e.g. Transcend 16GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card (TS16GSDHC10E). In 640 mode (good enough), it seems to use around 100MB / minute, so 16GB should be good for around 1600 minute (about 26 hours). Probably 4GB is sufficent, depending how much video do you want to store. It stores the videos as fixed length (or less when you turn off before duration expired), default is 2 minutes, I prefer longer duration, selected 5 minutes. I find the saved clips are seamless, there is no gap between them at all. When the disk fills up it starts rolling over the oldest clips with newest ones by default (there is setting to disable), and I haven't gotten that far yet.<br /><br />You should do some setup before using it. For example, set the time and date. That's not too hard, and you only have to do it once.<br /><br />Note: Removing the battery or formatting the card resets some of the setup, such as time and date.<br /><br />Here are some usage notes, and step-by-step operating examples:<br /><br />\"HD DVR\" as of April 2015<br />2.5\" TFT LCD screen<br />supports up to 32GB SD/MMC card<br /><br />Basic Operation<br /> Setup (one time, see below)<br /> When 12V power turns on, recording starts<br /> When 12V power turns off, recording stops<br /> To retrieve videos, plug into PC, appears as USB drive (also camera device)<br /><br />Extended Operation<br /> Can record and play back video, camera, and audio<br /> By manipulating the buttons (operations aren't very intuitive)<br /><br />Case Buttons:<br />Power (lights with power) Button<br /> *Power input overrides (Power button has no effect when USB power is connected)<br /> *Can not turn off in recording mode<br />OK (Record / Snapshot) (lights with charging) Button<br /> Starts / Stops recording in record mode<br /> Take a picture in picture mode<br /> Selects item in menu mode<br /><br />Display Buttons:<br /> Menu -

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Amazing for the price!!!", "text": "I have moved from Hawaii to Portland and the driving here is so different. I've nearly gotten clipped quite a few times and people run red lights more often (or maybe I'm just noticing it more). Of course intersections are about twice to three times bigger, so it could be cars trying to beat the \"yellow\" light /shrug?<br /><br />Anyhoo, I've been watching youtube vids of insurance scammers and what not and been looking for an HD cam for a reasonable cost. So far this has been amazing. I haven't had to use footage from it yet, but it records audio + 720p with no issues.<br /><br />The menu is kinda strange to navigate but once I set it up, I haven't had to touch it again. I had an 8GB SD card in the cam at first but realized that it wasn't enough storage and got a 32GB SD card. I want to say it records 3-4 days of driving and holds it reasonably well.<br /><br />The 8GB SD card is ok as long as you pull it the same day anything occurs. If you have a smaller SD card in the cam you may want to have a back up card of the same size handy, if you want to keep footage. I'm sure if I turned off audio, it would save on space but I really wanted the audio in case someone starts yelling at me for any reason (I also have a 5 year old daughter that is often in the car with me, so it's for her protection too to have the audio).<br /><br />If this ever breaks, I will buy it again!!! If this is discontinued I will cry. Thanks for the awesome product and if we get a second car, I will be getting one of these for that car too!!<br /><br />**Update: Husband knocked the first one off the window by loading a dining chair in the front seat (we were moving).

Most of these cheap units have many problems but I must say this one has done an excellent job. It comes with a very long 12v adapter cord, which allows you to 'bury' it around your dash trim for a cleaner look. The camera quality, which I know everyone wants to know, its acceptable for the job. To see the 'bigger picture', NOT to see license plate numbers at a distance or finite details.<br /><br />The packaging came nice and neat, all cords were there, I got a 32 gb SD card so I can have enough room to record 10/min at a time. Playback is quick and easy. The unit is very light. The suction cup is 10x better than my Garmin Nuvi ($150+ unit mind you). The mount allows some nice flexibility to rotate or 'pivot'/angel the cam if you have a funky windshield.<br /><br />The only issue I had was the rotating of the camera from left to right on the mount. It has a strange 'screw washer' that you have to align just right with the camera for it to face forward. If the screw is on too tight, by the time you screw the camera on top, the threshold of it stopping makes it cock-eyed so you have to partially unscrew little by little to get the line up just right.<br /><br />The sound quality of playback is poor, but you can make words during conversations and such in the car. I paid for a dash cam, not an HD camcorder, right?<br /><br />The battery on the unit is great, the motion detector works like a charm.<br /><br />Nightvision is borderline acceptable.

It says that it does, but it doesn't. This dash cam records in standard definition which is okay with me. As long as I can have proof of my innocence in a crash ill be happy. Another flaw about this product is that the battery only lasts about 10 minutes on a full charge, it is complete crap. That being said, the dash cam must always be plugged into a power source when you are using it. This dash cam's default language is set to Chinese when you get it, but I did some research online and 10 minutes later I found out how to switch it to English. The instructions to do this should come with the product but it doesn't. A couple good things about this is that it actually does work, with all flaws put to the side, I guess the camera does what it's suppose to do, record.

Honestly it is really quite good for what it is. Works well during the day, not well at all at night.<br />The microphone also wasn't working on mine at all... I actually opened it up and took a look around, it appears there is a micro-resistor missing on the mic circuit. I may attempt jumping the connection if I get bored some day, will post results. Otherwise, this thing is really simply designed inside. Was able to poke around, without breaking anything, so I'd definitely think that says something as far as build quality. Considering how &#34;cheesy&#34; this thing looks at first glance. Given though that some components are quite cheap, and so is the plastic. Quite little sacrifice to make something that can retail so inexpensive though!<br /><br />Another note... It's also quite strange, like a quantum observation effect or something, lol, because I've never seen it happen. Though sometimes when I leave the car and come back the LCD screen shifts colors quite randomly. As in, green is now pink, pink is now green. Again, heh, I haven't ever actually seen it change. It's only if I leave and come back it seems. &#62;_&#60;<br /><br />Others are correct, this ONLY charges from 12v connection.

The only problem I have experienced is that the camera lost focus when the seasons changed, the fix was to open the camera, remove the camera lens assembly and adjust the focus as you would a manual focus webcam, this can be challenging, as the focus was set at the factory using instant glue, but with a pair of pliers I was able to break the bond and make my adjustments. If you have to adjust the focus, this will void your warranty, but at the price, its not even worth returning, just make sure you disconnect the ribbon cable carefully, break the glue bond, reconnect the ribbon cable, set to webcam and make your adjustments at a reasonable distance, and wear some gloves, as the sheet metal that holds the actual CMOS is sharp.", "images": [], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AEHODEGDG773MFZETV4HWDVLAZRQ", "timestamp": 1366697004000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Just Buy It!", "text": "Like you, I have read good reviews, bad reviews, and mixed reviews on this camera. One helpful insight here - sort the reviews by &#34;newest first&#34;. Manufacturers often change and frequently improve their products, so older reviews may not be accurate. Here's my story;<br /><br />  I took the plunge and bought 2 of these right off the bat, one for personal vehicle and one for work truck. I also bought 32 Gb memory cards for each. Upon arrival, one unit seemed brand new and the other looked like someone had returned it. Awesome! After spending a whopping 15 minutes setting up the date/time and recording settings (they both arrived with partially charged batteries) I was ready to go. The &#34;used&#34; unit did have a vertical line on the screen (yes, I removed the protector), but you know - if I am staring at this tiny screen while I am driving (so I can see on the screen what is ahead of me?) I probably need more than a dash cam! The vertical line has no affect on anything. Now here's where it gets complicated - I plugged the units into their respective power plugs, inserted the SD cards, and stuck the suction cup to the windshield. Yup, that's it - done!<br /><br />  The suction cups hold well wherever you put them.The mount is awesome, not huge, and allows for many angles. The cord is very long and tucks away easily. Both lighter plugs work flawlessly. Recording started immediately, creates a new file every 15 minutes as desired, and loops back over the oldest file once the SD card is full. I removed the cards to see what I was actually recording and was actually impressed with the quality of the video. No, you can't read license plates at a distance - but then again my eyes can't either so why would I expect a camera to be able to? The video quality is more than ample, trust me. Night time recording is not great, but again - if you know anything about security/surveillance cameras, none work as good in the dark as they do in daylight. Darkness is the bane of any camera.<br /><br />  Seriously, for $25 + a $20 SD card you really can't go wrong with these cameras. They do what they are supposed to do and they do it really well. I ordered a third for my Wife's vehicle, they're just that cool! Report a drunk driver? Give your card to the police. See an accident or hit and run happen in front of you? The proof is on the card. Someone hits you? Your insurance company would love to see the card! Leave it recording overnight and see who's stealing your newspaper or breaking in to neighborhood cars.

I'm lucky that it works at all, but as others have stated, It's not really 720 hd, not wide angle lens, audio was horrible, battery won't hold a charge long, frame rate is inconsistent, and there's a few seconds of delay between recording cycles. But informed consumers already know all this and that you'd have to spend at least 3-4x to rectify most of these issues...<br /><br />So yeah, it's an entry level DVR for $20.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Decent dash cam at a low price", "text": "The only reason I decided to buy this camera was because it was under $15. I figured I couldn't go wrong at that price. After opening the packaging I was worried by how cheap it felt. It is made with very low quality plastic and you can certainly feel the cheapness to it. While it is cheap, I am not disappointed in the purchase at all. It captures audio and video just fine (may not be the best quality but I expected that). I tested all three video quality modes and decided to stick with the 640x480. I couldn't tell a difference in quality between the three; however, the 640x480 resolution captured the widest and tallest video. The two higher defs captured the same width, but the height was shorter. Also, you can record more video at the lower definition. I was a little worried that the timer showed only being able to record 1.5 hours in 640x480 quality with a 32gb SD card. It should be able to hold much more space, but I have yet to use it enough to see if it holds more or not. Other reviewers say they get over 9 hours which sounds more accurate, so might just be an inaccurate timer.<br /><br />The car charger it comes with has a very long cable so you can tuck it up through the roof and around the side. The suction cup mount works great and is easy to install and remove. I really like the flip down screen. I only use it to set up the settings and then line up the camera for the best view. I don't drive with it down and it hides nicely behind my rear view mirror.<br /><br />While the listing states it gets 120 degree site, I have to question that. When mounted underneath my rear view mirror, I cannot see the sides of my car by the bumper. If someone were to side swipe me, it may not capture that. It would show that I stayed in my lane so that may be enough evidence to prove your case.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Auto records when vehicle starts<br />Auto shuts off when vehicle is turned off<br />Auto deletes older clips once memory card is full<br />Flip down screen lets you see exactly what it is recording<br />Easy to swivel and record police out the side window<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cheap plastic (worried about melting in heat)<br />Only shows 1 hour 30 minutes available on 32gb SD card (in lowest definition - only 30 minutes in HD)<br />Not the best video/audio quality<br /><br />Overall Impression:<br />8/10 for value (price to quality ratio). It records video and audio and was only $15. Can't beat that!<br />4/10 for overall quality. Plastic is very cheap and might melt in the sun, but again, it was only $15.<br />I have no regrets with this purchase and plan on continuing to use it.

You have to treat it with care so that it lasts a long time. Mine fell off the windshield, smashed the dash and hit the floor numerous times without breaking.  Some people have complained about it not staying on the windshield very well.  I used to have that problem until the light bulb went off inside my head and I realized the suction cup needed moisture to hold it up.  You can figure out how you want to moisten it yourself.  I have my way.  If your windshield is too hot or too cold, you have to wipe off the windshield and moisten the suction cup.  What comes with the recorder isn't cheaply made--it's something you deal with when it comes to any suction cup and temperatures. The battery isn't going to last forever, and like cellphones, will need to be plugged into the car charger while recording more often than not.  The car charger will also possibly last just a year.

I bought another one to replace the last.  What can I say?  It's affordable. If I have to replace it every year, it'll take me 10 years before I could have bought a nicer camera..  Chances are a nicer camera won't last 10 years. So I think I'll end up ahead.<br /><br />Update:  The new one came in, though it looks the same, the buttons are lit up red instead of blue.  The old charger/power I have the wires hidden all the way through the dash and ceiling of the car no longer works with this one.  The one I just received has a mini USB connection.  This is a little frustrating, as rerunning the power wire, makes a huge difference on rebuying every year.  I'm going to leave the old power and put the new power in.  Perhaps the third I buy will fit one or the other.", "images": [], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AF47ARSSFMUW6M43QSJB6PZBBK7Q", "timestamp": 1363782387000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

Out of nowhere, while I was charging the battery through my laptop, it started popping the Welcome screen on and off. I searched the reviews here and learned about a reset button.. I tried a toothpick, a &#34;can of air&#34; stick, you name it.. Still not getting anywhere, couldn't even feel a reset button, getting frustrated and knowing if I take it apart I might void some kind of warranty.. I gave up and actually took it apart. I found NO reset button, it's a regular circuit board connected to two wires which connects to the battery port. What I had done though all my poking, was disconnect the blue wire from the circuit board. Once I did this, with the battery in and plugged into the USB the camera appeared, but froze 15 seconds later with me being unable to power it off and then on again.... I thought &#34;Huh..&#34; and wanted to solderer the blue wire back to the board again. After I did this, it went back to the original issue (popping welcome screen). Obviously, there is a short in the board somewhere. This device is an electronic nightmare. Don't buy it unless you have some extra cash to blow and love solving mysteries or take a 50% chance of it working for you.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "It was low quality to begin with & broke after 1 week", "text": "UPDATE: from when I posted my original review . . .<br /><br />I have now used it for about 3+ Weeks.  I reduced my rating from a 3-star to a 1-star.  After about 1 week of use, the screen started going all-white.  It turned out it was still recording, but the screen was all white and I couldn't see what it was recording.  The only way I knew it was recording was the faint blue LED was flashing.  But then, after a few more days, it was starting to make awful clicking sounds and the blue LED was no longer flashing (so I knew it wasn't recording).<br /><br />At that point, I had no idea what is was doing (if anything) and considered it broken beyond use.<br /><br />My recommendation is now - do NOT buy this.  It broke on me within 1 to 2 weeks.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW . . .<br /><br />The only reason I even give this a 3-star is because it was $20, and for $20, it pretty much delivers about $20 worth of value.  I bought an $80 dash cam similar to this one about 6 months ago and it was a piece of junk and broke within a week or so after I got it.  So rather than get ripped off $80 again, I decided to risk $20.<br /><br />After using this for about 2 days, I'll summarize the pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros -<br /><br />(1) It was $20 (that's hard to beat).<br />(2) It worked.<br />(3) The windshield mount was solid and worked well.<br /><br />Cons -<br /><br />(1) The video quality is always VGA (640x480) regardless of what setting you select.<br />(2) Because it is VGA - you cannot read signs or license plate numbers.<br />(3) The microphone audio quality was highly distorted and unusable.<br />(4) The owner documentation was unhelpful - not worth the paper it was printed on.<br />(5) It took me some time to figure out the menu navigation and getting it configured, but eventually I got through it.<br />(6) There is a pastic protector on the screen that is a real pain to get off.  I eventually had to use a \"push pin\" (the kind you use on a cork board) to get the plastic coating to lift off the screen.<br /><br />For $20, I think I got what I paid for.<br /><br />I would rather spend $50 to $75 and get a HD dashcam that had good audio and looked to be of good quality, but for $20, it will work for now.", "images": [], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AHUDINPSVCKRTCBZF2IWAIZZCA6Q", "timestamp": 1356372984000, "helpful_vote": 51, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Inexpensively valuable", "text": "Actually, I was looking for something for \"Rodent Surveillance\"... I thought I would give this thing a shot since it was cheaper than a round of drinks.  The other reviews were very helpful, and although some of the reviewers had bad experiences, I thought, why not.  Since ordering the camera, the price went up $4.33. Set up was pretty simple, once I figured out the menu sequence.  I plugged it in via the 12v adapter that I already had, and set it on a small tripod aimed at a poison bait tray and peanut butter traps. Specs state it supports up to a 32gb card. I used an 8GB card. When full, the unit records over the earliest video taken, then proceeds to \"fill\" the card again. It recorded for about two and a half days straight, all the while not capturing video of any rodents. (Neither poison eaten nor peanut butter traps tripped). The IR night vision probably wouldn't suffice on a dashboard, but it was more than adequate to see what was happening around the bait tray. Hey, at least it was cheaper than a round of drinks...<br /><br />Testing video quality on the dashboard of my vehicle, I mounted it on the windshield using the supplied suction cup mount, and ran a few errands.  The manual says it will record in three different graphic configurations....QVGA, VGA and SXGA.  This one did not capture video in the SXGA setting. (Just sound), Don't know why, but the quality difference of the video captured in the other two settings is minimal. . Don't get me wrong... If you are using this to capture vehicular traffic, the quality is more than adequate.  My PC was able to see the .AVI files, no problem. I used an SD card reader, not the supplied USB cable.  The video you see in the other reviews is spot on  actually.  The menu is a bit frustrating, and the manual is nearly useless. It's more for reference than it is a guide on how to use the product. ...But hey, this thing was cheaper than a round of drinks!!<br /><br />Four stars...

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "To clear up all the confusion about this product", "text": "EDIT: After two months of the product working smoothly, my recorder just died the other day and no longer will turn on.<br /><br />I wanted to write a review to clear up the extremely mixed reviews you get about this product. I'll write this review in sections, so it's easier to find what you're looking for.<br /><br />Why I bought this dashcam:<br />I bought this camera because I didn't have much money to drop on a dashcam right now and I needed one quickly because I'm going on a trip in a couple days. I had looked up a bunch of different ones, but decided to go for this one due to it's price. I rated this 4-stars because for $20, it does a great job, but it could be better in video quality by just a little bit. I just received it today and will be updating this review later.<br /><br />Video:<br />First and foremost, you get what you pay for. This dashcam is not in any way HD like it says. The video quality is fairly poor, but you can still make out the things around you fine. I'd say it's probably around 360p (no higher than that).  If you want to be able to read signs and license plates, then stop right here and go look for another product, because there's no way it will happen with this one. It has a pretty large view of what's in front of you because of it's fisheye lens, but it doesn't cover your whole windshield.<br /><br />Product and mount:<br />The plastic this camera is made out of is a pretty cheap and flimsy plastic, so you have to be careful with it, but as long as you don't manhandle it, it shouldn't break. The suction cup is very sturdy and doesn't seem like it will fall off.<br /><br />Audio:<br />This camera does record audio and fairly well for the $20 that it costs. You can hear to the backseat (if the person isn't speaking too quietly) and the radio (if it's not down too low). It is a muffled audio, but it's better than nothing. I have yet to see if it can hear from outside with the windows down.<br /><br />Manual:<br />A lot of people's reviews on this product have been complaining thoroughly about the manual. I cannot figure out what the problem is, though. There are four pages of English in the manual and you can understand them perfectly fine. It isn't in broken English at all. There are a few spelling errors in some spots, but they aren't repeated. Just typos (ex. Pwoer = power, manu = menu, dode = mode, sysetm = system). The manual covers all of the buttons, operation instructions, and many of the menu settings - but not all. There are a few settings on camera that are not listed or explained in the manual that I cannot figure out what they do, so I have just left them on their default settings.<br /><br />Menu:<br />The menu is very straight forward and easy to navigate through. As long as you read the instructions, you should have no problem setting up your camera. The camera has the looping feature which allows you to record in 2, 5, or 10 minute intervals. Once the card gets filled, it then rerecords over the oldest file that isn't locked.<br /><br />Modes:<br />There are four different modes on the camera. They are as follows: record, picture, audio, and playback (where you review your videos, pictures, audio). It is easy to cycle through these and delete or lock (if you do not want them looped over).<br /><br />One annoying thing aside from the quality of the video is that whenever you go over a bump, the camera rattles because the mount is not completely attached to the suction cup, so when you play it back, you can hear the rattling noise. It doesn't affect the video at all, it's just what you hear and can get a little annoying if you're out over a bunch of little bumps.<br /><br />I hope this review help clear up some of the extreme reviews on both sides. It is not at all a terrible product for it's price, but it's also not amazing.<br /><br />If you are looking for a dashcam that will last you years and with good video and audio, look elsewhere and do not consider this one.<br /><br />If you don't want to spend much, but would still like to record what's in front of you while driving and you aren't too nitpicky about the video quality, this camera will do just fine. If you get in an accident, this camera will be all the proof you need.", "images": [], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AGQXGS6WUBG6RRAOZQTF7ZJXTSJQ", "timestamp": 1372290329000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

It took exactly an hour for me to get it switched to English.<br />Turn on camera.<br />1) Press Menu button twice.<br />2) Down button once.<br />3) Record button once.<br />4) Up to English.<br />5) Press Record again! I missed this several times.<br /> The instructions are less than basic. I found, if it was plugged into USB, I couldn't use the menu. So, I'd take it back out to the car to recharge. It ran out of charge in less than 2 hours. The menu will work while in car charger. Also, it can be unplugged from cig. lighter and will continue recording when plugged back in. The motion sensor setting will be lost, however. I'm getting a little radio interference on AM, but not FM. I can replay video on the camera's monitor, but not on my Chrome Book, just sound. So, I loaded it to Youtube and it worked. Pictures will come up on Chrome. The on screen instructions are as misleading as the manual. You should press Record(it functions like ENTER), most times, to select a function.<br />It has 1,3,5,10 min. settings for video files. Takes me about 3X the time to load (and process) to YouTube. I can tell a slight difference in video quality settings on  sunny days. No pixelation on higher settings, but takes up the same megabytes. Pretty good, like other reviewers' posted videos, but not enough to read car tags. The sound recorder is very low on 6(settings 0-6). There are 3 cam modes; camera, record and files. Each one has it's own menu(s).<br />It stopped recording after a few days. Pressing 'format' fixed it. It drops files and/or resets if left in the sun. Even on a 80* day, parked in the sun with windows cracked, it will drop files and reset to Chinese and 10 minute files. If I take it out of the hot window when parked, it keeps the files and settings. If I park it in the shade, it'll keep the files. Cam will work w/o battery, but you'll need to reset date & time after it's been unplugged.<br />It does work as a good deterrent for tailgaters. They come flying up on me, figure out there's a camera there and back way off. After being followed and verbally threatened again last month, the deterrence is worth the money I paid.<br />Used one month, so far. Ordered another battery bl-5c. The original is just barely enough. Camera works well as long as it's kept out of direct sun while parked. Battery died 8/30/2014 after sitting in partial shade for an hour on another 90 degree day with high humidity. The battery actually started emitting a high pitched hissing sound. I pulled it out to prevent a fire. Took it inside and cooled it off, it started working again. The battery is a definite hazard.<br />1/16/15-6 months, still working with the replacement 'gold', high amp. battery I bought on here. LOPURS-2450mah-Capacity-Business-Battery. I had to replace charger. It wasn't making a good contact at the camera.<br />Most IMPORTANT, if the camera doesn't have a replaceable battery, don't buy it. I've bought 4 different cameras(2 w/replaceable batteries, 2 w/o). Every one had a weak, almost useless battery.<br />9/12/15-Camera still works, but I've gone through 3 Cigarette lighter adapters, one was DOA. They have bad contact points, so I bought a cig.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Not as god as expected", "text": "[[VIDEOID:60195e598a8732dd3861efe7bf5cd050]] I have to say that this one works better than my previous one, but the previous one took a few months to start misbehaving (turning off on it's own, freezing, and recording quality dropped like a rock at the end).  After letting the previous one sit, it seems to work a lot better.  The new one operates correctly, but the video quality is not as good as the previous one was originally.  The previous one filled about 90% of my screen (2011 15\" MacBook Pro). The new one has grainy video and fills the screen about 60% of the screen.  It really does not look like 1280x960.  The video dimensions seem to match the size of a transcoded, standard def, DVD.  Check the video I've uploaded.  The first part of the video is the new cam that you are looking to purchase (sorry about the Kleenex box.  A good reason not to have anything on your dash) and the other two are from my previous cam.  The video editing ended up enlarging the poorer quality video and shrinking the higher quality one, so some imagination is probably required.  The IR is OK, just make sure your window is clean or you will see ALL of the dirt as white dots.  I've used this in the city and in the country.  The city lights help a lot and you only see what your headlights illuminate in total darkness.  I have not carried it in my hand and walked around at night though (not interested in making another Blarewitch movie) The menu on this new one is not as user friendly as it could be and the instructions were not much help being poorly translated from another language.  I've noticed that the manual seems to be taken from other models (the referencing using numbers and a diagram stops in the middle of the instructions).  This would be OK for a back cam and I think I will buy a better one (one like my previous one for about $32) for a much better quality video.  I just hope these don't stop working right after the warranty is up like my previous one.  I would really like to see these made in the USA or somewhere other than China.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Review includes installation instructions", "text": "Update 2/19/2016  I made changes to my prior update.  And after being run off the road by a driver who came up behind me fast, went around me to the left, and then cut in between me and the car in front of me and off the exit, a maneuver that caused me to go onto the shoulder of the exit to avoid a crash, I've decided to put a camera in my rear window to compliment the recordings from the front windshield.<br /><br />Update 2/6/16:  This particular camera had been running in my vehicle for a year without any intervention.  It turns itself on when I start the car (because it is plugged into a cigarette lighter that has power only when the key is on). I had occasion this month to remove the SD card to provide the recording of an incident to police.  Picture quality from the SD card on a 19&#34; computer monitor wasn't outstanding but was pretty good. But the stunning thing was the officer said my recording was about as good as the recordings from their squad cars on cameras that cost hundreds of dollars.  The biggest difference is that this camera is more &#34;wide angle&#34; so distant objects are smaller (but you take in more of in front of your vehicle so it shows things coming from the side which would be good in the case of a crash from the side at an intersection). And to my surprise the sound (including my comments about the incident - so watch it!) was a lot better than I originally believed it was. And I discovered that based on my driving history (I drive about 1,000 miles a month, more than half at highway speeds) a 32 Gbyte card holds a month's worth of driving.  I'm upping my rating from four to five stars with a caveat - I've purchased nine of these cameras, three were defective, and two I have not installed yet.  At under $20 each it is not worth returning them - especially as I had sent the defective ones (unopened) to family members out of state so shipping costs were exceeding the cost of the cameras just to find they were defective.  Condition seems to depend on the seller (based on when I forwarded them), and unfortunately I cannot associate defective cameras with particular seller(s) as I didn't keep records.<br /><br />Note to reviewers that complain that this camera does not record long on the built in battery.  It appears the battery is intended primarily to maintain stored information.  On SOME of the cameras there is a choice of whether to power solely from an external source (which I elected when offered) or from the battery.  Others don't seem to offer an option. I did by accident put one camera in battery mode and it recorded for about 40 minutes while I was in a restaurant - but whether that was the cause or whether I'd done something else, the wrap-around when the card was full didn't function.  I have therefore (2/19/2016) executed a &#34;reset&#34; and reprogrammed the camera.  Based on experience when doing the programming I chose the 5 minute segments.  I still would not expect the camera to function for hours on the built-in battery.  But with external power it works well and even keeps pretty accurate time over months.<br /><br />And one more thought (which is why I've purchased nine cameras).  With a 120 V to 12V cigarette plugged adapter this would make an extremely inexpensive security camera.  Now to find time to install and try out this idea.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/12/2016  Have only tried one camera from Elecmall.  After three weeks it is working fine.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/2/2015  First the good news.  Driving through a town with 10K population I saw a town owned vehicle make a dangerous maneuver.  I decided to write a complaint to the police department because it was so egregious and dangerous (there'd have been a head-on crash if I had not been alert).  I wrote the letter and then attempted to copy the recording of the incident from my dash cam.  Watching the dash cam I saw why the vehicle had done what it did and cannot fault the driver (hit my car or a child).  Tore up the letter.  Convinced me these things are useful.  I purchased two dash cameras from FX Victoria in response to a reviewer recommending that vendor.  The two dash cams from FX Victoria are still working perfectly and producing very clear images and time stamps.<br /><br />I was so pleased with the dash cams that I ordered three more, but FX Victoria was out and Amazon placed my order with Beelike.<br /><br />Now the bad news.  Beelike must sell reconditioned or defective dash cams.  First one was bad out of the box.  Second one developed fuzzy green lines before the first time I tried playing back my SD card.  I tried to order three more from FX - Victoria and Amazon is listing Elecmall as the seller.  As another reviewer rating the dash cams a one-star said, apparently some sellers are selling knock offs or refurbs or simply bad units returned for a refund.  Be suspicious of low prices.  There are huge profits to be made by selling, even for a low price, stuff that should have gone in the trash bin.  I'll update later on the quality from Elecmall (for $13.50 each).<br /><br />Original review with installation instructions:<br /><br />Seems to be a good device for the cost.  Picture is pretty clear on the device screen but I suspect it will be pretty &#34;grainy&#34; on a large computer monitor. Mount is reasonably rigid and suction cup holds well. 120 degree field of view is a good compromise between being so broad you can't recognize anything 25 feet in front of the vehicle and being so narrow that nothing coming from the side is not recorded prior to impact.<br /><br />Caveat \u2013 I have just installed and tested this device.  I have at this point no long-term experience with it.<br />I spent hours setting up the device.  The instructions are not as bad as with some Chinese products, but are clearly a translation.  After one has gone through the installation process in great detail, the instructions make a lot of sense.<br />In hopes of saving others a lot of time setting up the device, I will share my insights to date.<br />Caveat \u2013 This review is written in American English in American English (Arabic) characters. I apologize, but I am not fluent enough in any other language to express the subtleties involved in other than English.<br />Caveat \u2013 This device is complex.  Apparently there are several variations to the basic device available and the sellers do not make it clear which variant of the device they are selling/shipping.  For example, the \u201cFeatures\u201d listed for the ones I purchased stated: \u201cRecording resolution:1280x960 / 720x480 / 640x480 pixels.\u201d  I didn\u2019t realize that the little box above the list of features which said \u201cOnly 720P\u201d meant I was choosing a variant that only had a single recording resolution.  (The little box is similar to the boxes which appear when the product is available in a variety of colors.)<br />Here is what I recommend when setting up the device.<br />1. Plug the power cable which comes in the box with the device into the USB connection on the device under the flip-open panel on the left side, and then plug the cable into a power source on your vehicle (a cigarette lighter &#34;plug&#34; most likely).  Allow the camera \u201cto charge\u201d for at least an hour (one seller recommends 2 - 3 hours) before you do anything else.  Disconnect the device from the external power source. [It is easier and just as effective to unplug the end of the power cable that is not connected to the device.]<br />2. There are two ways to \u201cturn on\u201d the device. On the back there is a red (on mine) button on the left and white (on mine) button on the right.  The red button is the power On /Off.  Press and hold the red button for 3 seconds.  The device should power up.  Allow the device operate for 30 seconds. If you are going to power the device from an external source (12 or 24 volts from a vehicle via the USB connection via the supplied cable and a \u201ccigarette lighter\u201d plug) press the red button again to power off the device.  [I have not operated the device using the internal battery, so I\u2019m not sure how one would proceed if one planned to do so.] If you are going to power the device from an external source (a vehicle most likely) there is no need to turn the device on and off ever again using the red button.  If power is on continually at your cigarette lighter plug I'd recommend unplugging the cable from the lighter plug rather than using the red power On / Off button, but I believe either approach is viable. If the power is turned off at your cigarette lighter plug when you turn your ignition key off, then the device will power up and down &#34;automatically&#34; when you turn your vehicle on and off.<br />3. Plug the power cable into the vehicle. The device should power up in the video recording mode. Fold the device\u2019s display window down so it \u201changs\u201d below the device.<br />NOTE \u2013 It is important to know that the device has THREE operating MODES and FOUR MENUS.  Many of the criticisms in reviews appear to result from the user not realizing this.<br />[The \u201cMain Menu\u201d which is reached by pressing MENU twice when in any mode, provides for entering such things as Date and Time, Language, \u201cLight Frequency (50 or 60 Hz), Image format, Voice recording on / off, and most importantly \u201cSystem Reset\u201d which I presume erases all entries and \u201crestarts\u201d the entire system. While my manual says to reset the system by pressing a 1mm shaft gently into the \u201cReset Hole\u201d I cannot find such a hole on my variant.]<br />4. I found it necessary at the start of the process to press the white button \u201cto get the device\u2019s attention.\u201d  Until I did this the device didn\u2019t respond to any other buttons except the red button.  The white button is thereafter the \u201cSelect\u201d button which one pushes to choose a selection highlighted on a menu. On my variant the white button is labeled REC and I will hereinafter refer to it by that designation.<br />5. Just to familiarize yourself with the operation, press MODE (the right most button on the display screen bottom edge) three times at two second intervals.  You should see each of the three operating modes.  The modes are Video recording; Still image recording; and Playback.  On my variant of the device these displays for the modes are labeled \u201cVideo\u201d \u201cCapture\u201d and \u201cPlay\u201d on the screen.  In the first two modes the image on the screen \u201cmoves\u201d when the camera is moved, following what the camera lens is \u201cseeing\u201d.  In the third mode, \u201cPlay\u201d, the image is fixed.  What you see on the screen when in &#34;Play&#34; mode is the first frame recorded for the time segment during which recording happened. The date and time will appear on the bottom of the screen indicating when that segment, or photo, was recorded if the user selected to display date or date and time. At this point it doesn\u2019t matter much, you will learn about this attribute when you get the device configured as you want it. The date and time are how you find the segment you wish to view, so I STRONGLY recommend you elect to display date and time during set-up. In the &#34;Play&#34; mode you Up / Down to the desired segment to view, choosing by looking at the first frame and the associated date or date and time.  Some users in reviews have complained that the screen is \u201cfrozen\u201d and I suspect it is because they have the device in \u201cPlay\u201d mode but have not initiated playback of the &#34;chosen&#34; segment.<br />NOTE \u2013 If the display is not in English (the other alternatives are four languages in non-Arabic characters) proceed as follows, otherwise skip to step #6 below.<br />a. When in any Mode with no menu present on the screen (if there is, press MENU to remove the menu from the screen), press MENU.  Press MENU again.<br />Press \u201cDOWN\u201d once.  You are on the Language select line of the fourth menu. Press the REC (white on my variant) button to select Language.  Up / Down to English and press the REC button to select. (On my variant English is the language at the top of the list and the word English is in English. Press MENU to exit from menus and continue as described below.  If the language displayed is Chinese after doing this, repeat this step and select in turn each of the other languages listed. As there are only four languages, you ought to get English sooner or later.<br />6. To get to the menu for any Mode, press MENU when you in the mode for which you wish to select the attributes  you desire for that mode.  The types of selections the user can make for that mode are listed.  Up / Down to the items you wish to set. Press the REC button  to make selections. It is beyond the scope of my review to explain further how to navigate in menus. To set the date and time use Up / Down to obtain the correct digits for the various entities and REC (white button) to lock in the digits for each category of entry when it is correct (e.g. press REC after the digits for hours is correct, for example.  REC is pressed for each category of the Date and Time when they are correct.<br />7. Put the device in each of its three modes in turn and press MENU once.  This will bring up the menu for that mode. Make your selections as to how you wish the device to operate.  I STRONGLY recommend that you turn Motion Activation OFF if you are using this device as a drive cam.  I would only use Motion Activation if I were using the device as a security camera.  I STRONGLY recommend recording in five minute segments.<br /><br />NOTE: Some sellers recommend removing the lithium ion battery unless you are operating the device on battery power or are in the process of charging the battery. Those sellers say that after charging the battery can get \u201cvery hot\u201d if it is left in place with the device powered with the external power cable.  Unfortunately, in my experience, if you remove the battery you lose all the menu settings after a period of time.  That makes the device pretty useless for me.  I\u2019m not going to enter all the settings each time I drive my vehicles; I want the camera to come on when I turn on the key and shut off when I turn off the key.  HOWEVER, as the device is exposed to the hot sun by being in the windshield, I have covered the top of the device with aluminum foil to reduce heat absorption.  Several reviewers have complained the battery compartment cover has warped in the sun.  This may be a fatal flaw in the design for devices used in hot climates.<br /><br />I will update this review in the coming weeks or months as I gain experience with the device.<br /><br />One reviewer recommended not using more than a 16 gig card because otherwise there are too many segments to sort through.  My opinion is that most of the time you are going to want to access a recent segment so having stored many is not an issue as they are accessed in date order with the most recent last.  And if there is an issue about something that happened several days or weeks ago, the bigger the card the more likely you can at least find a recording of the event. Another reviewer recommended recording one minute segments.  If the quantity of segments to search through is an issue, having a segment for every minute of recording would maximize the number of segments to be handled.  Some reviewers complain about lines on the screen.  My unit had what looked like thick blue thread or felt tip pen doodling on the screen. The lines turned out to be on the protective film.  The film is not easy to get off.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Worth It", "text": "Note: My reviews reflect the \"value\" of a product as it relates to cost. This item was shipped and delivered extremely fast for standard shipping, ordered on Monday received it Thursday. thank you Amazon and UPS. The camera was packaged as well as any other electronic device that I have ever purchased online, with maybe the exception of Apple Products which tend to be pricey (and worth it) so they can afford a little extra luxo packaging. The camera was obviously brand new out of the box with all accessories included. Note: the 12v automotive power plug-in connects to the camera via the usb port, some pictures showed the plug as having a standard power plug. The camera has a port for a standard power supply plug but I guess there is no need for it. Be sure to remove the protective shipping film from the screen and the tape from over the battery terminals before you complain about a dirty scratched screen or non functioning battery. I used a 120v USB power supply (available cheap from Amazon) to power and charge the camera in my home. I took videos at various settings out my front window. I prefer the 720p setting as it seems to provide more of a widescreen closeup but with the same field of view as the 640 setting which yields a 4:3 ratio like an old TV. There did not seem to be any difference between the 1080p and 720p setting. The video quality is more than adequate for it's intended use. The microphone is very sensitive producing clear audio and can be turned off. The complaints in other reviews about the instructions are valid. The important thing to remember is that you must use the Video Record button along with the menu and up down buttons and finish each setting by pressing the Video Record button before exiting settings. I purchased a Transcend 32GB class 10 SD card with the camera and it slipped right in and worked perfectly with no formatting needed. Connecting the camera via the supplied USB cable allowed me to view the .avi videos on my computer as well as save, edit and or delete them. As for the overall quality of the unit, I see no area to fault. Yes it is light weight plastic but do you really want a heavy plastic brick attached to your windshield. The case provides adequate protection for the electronics and how it feels in your hand should not be a concern, as if it were a phone or a razor. I have not tried the camera in a vehicle yet, but my experience with Radar Detectors leads me to conclude that the hefty windshield mount should be up to the task. I will update this review as I gain experience with the unit, but for now and for the price, Five Stars. Update 01/25/15: The night vision LED's only work at close range, I moved the camera around a totally dark room and objects had to be only a few feet away be visible on the screen. It would be best to leave them off for night driving and rely on ambient light from street lamps, vehicles etc. I did not expect much from the IR LED's so it does not change my rating and I doubt some of the more expensive cameras are any better.", "images": [], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AGOPTDTO2XFDZF3JHNU5JC3HUS3Q", "timestamp": 1422042625000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Comically horrible", "text": "This camera is like the movie 'plan 9 from outerspace' it's so horrible you can't help but laugh.<br /><br />Now for those who think I'm just being overly picky for the price: I didn't expect 720p (honestly, it looks like maybe 160p at best - I think a first generation Motorola Razr could have out performed it) so I wasn't worried about that (I noted that from previous reviews) The audio recording was terrible, but again I knew that from other reviews (and the $14 price) However....<br /><br />The part I didn't expect to fail was the primary reason for having it: recording. For the two hours it worked, it did its job: $14 is a cheap insurance policy to simply prove liability at the very least (even if it can't see faces or licence plates) but thereafter it said &#34;No SD card&#34; tried taking it out, replacing etc, resetting, formatting etc. No good.<br /><br />It's $14, so I really don't think I'm going to bother returning it (The effort to repackage and ship the thing back would cost me more in time than its worth)<br /><br />Save your money - put it towards a better rated unit in the $40-60 range.<br /><br />UPDATE: I decided to run an older SD card and it started recording again. I used it for a few days without anything to write home about. However, today it was about 90 degrees out and when I went to go for a drive the camera went was recording just pitch-black nothing (sound only) as the car became cooler, the screen started to show multicolored lines and got progressively 'better' (better being a very generous word)<br /><br />UPDATE 2: After deciding to dissect this horrid abortion of the lowest Chinese-built technology, I discovered the lens was factory set out of focus - WAY out of focus. After fixing that issue and putting it back together I will say you can actually see things quite a bit sharper (IE a car looks less like a blob) but the video quality is still awful.<br /><br />Final notes: The battery for this unit is the same one that I used for my Sylvania SP234 Bluetooth speaker, so I can't bitch about having a spare battery for it .<br /><br />Overall; for $14 I got a spare battery for my speaker, a really good 10ft USB car charger (great for my GPS!), a decent windshield mount for a future purchase of a better dash cam and quite a bit of fun taking it apart and harvesting parts off of it.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QsXRehwuL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QsXRehwuL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QsXRehwuL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AHKBEZWZUH3SOB3TPPOICXW6V6OQ", "timestamp": 1437883758000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

You will not get any improvement in regards to image quality if you choose to capture 1.3M, 2M or 3 Mpixel image or record it in 720P or higher. Here, look at the attached image below. On the left is a fragment cut from 3MP  still image captured using the camera (no resizing, other than the crop). On the right is the same fragment cut from a VGA capture and then resized to match the size of the fragment on the left. There is little of no difference in quality between two. So this is it. Do not use higher capture/recording resolutions, just use VGA. I would recommend using low saturation and low sharpness settings. By doing so, for this particular device, you preserve more details. You can always improve image on the computer if you have to. I am going to use it as VGA video/still camera for my 2003 Civic.

I could spend a couple hundred dollars for better picture quality, but the likelihood of needing every person's license plate as they pass by me is too minimal for me to shell out the money and worry about it getting stolen.<br /><br />Like a few other reviewers, I was unlucky enough to have the camera arrive with the language preset to Russian. However, I followed the directions in the manual and I figured out in about 2-3 minutes how to change the language.<br /><br />I keep it on 15-minute recordings at the highest quality and I get roughly 2-3 hours of video on an 8g card. My commute is 1hr so that is plenty, but carrying a spare just in case is a good idea.<br /><br />In 6 months, the best thing I captured was having a car entering onto the freeway at about 40mph.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good value but only fair quality", "text": "I ordered two of these units as I wanted to have both a rear and a front facing camera. After having used them for a few days I have a few comments. Both my units look the same externally but operate differently. The buttons light up different colors and one blinks in record and one is solid in record. The menu/options are quite different between the two units. The sound quality is very different as one is very clear and the other one has much noise. If other comments or instructions in these reviews don't work for you it may be you have a different version of software. After playing with the various menues I have gotten both units to work. They go into record as soon as I give them power and continue to record over files until you stop the unit. A 16GB SD card gives me around 4 hours of recording. While I can't read plate numbers while at highway speed I also have these units on when my car is parked. Other cars parking in front or behind me can have their plates read quite clearly. In parking spots is where alot of my damage occurs so this is just what I was looking for! If you want plate numbers to be recorded on the highway I would just speak them loudly so they are recorded on the audio part of the videos. The same with a description of the other driver or any other info. I did notice with both units that they can lockup or get distorted displays. You have to slide off the top cover and remove the battery to reset them at that point.<br /><br />The overall quality of these units is fair to poor, but I paid a total of $46 for two including shipping! I have an HD Sony camcorder that I use on the road when I want a top quality recording but these units are set and forget. They will capture that unexpected accident when someone cuts you off and then jams on the brakes. Rear end collisions are almost always the fault of the guy in back. Also a good insurance scam. If you could show that the other driver jumped in front of you and slammed his brakes on for no reason then you just more than paid for the cost of these units.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "I'd like to address a few of the things that have ...", "text": "This is a 3 star product that gets a 4th star for the price (Bumped down to 3 afterall. See that &#34;Product Inconsistency&#34; portion of my review for update.). I'd like to address a few of the things that have been brought up in other reviews.<br /><br />- Documentation: There are a lot of complaints about the terrible instructions that come with the camera. I won't say that these reviewers are wrong, but to be honest, I never needed them. The menus are intuitive, and simple to navigate. The only thing that's a bit unorthodox is that the &#34;record&#34; button serves as the &#34;select&#34; button when in the menus. It took me no more than 5 minutes to navigate all the menus and set everything the way I wanted.<br /><br />- Build quality: It's exactly what I expected for the price (which isn't great). It feels flimsy in your hands, and it IS NOT heat resistant. To be fair, I was testing it in the middle of Texas summer, so we're talking extreme heat. With that said, after a few hours in the car, some of the plastic body was warped and, although it would turn on, the camera would not send any signal to the screen. 15 mins in the fridge and it was working fine again. Lesson learned, I'll just take it inside whenever not in use.<br /><br />- Video quality: Not excellent, but not bad either. There are plenty of reviews here with video samples, and they are accurate representations of the video you get.<br /><br />- Audio quality: Like the video, it's nothing special, but it's there. As other reviewers have said, there is often a significant amount of feedback from inferior/unshielded electronic components.<br /><br />- Product inconsistency: I ordered two of these at the same time for each of my cars. While they are largely the same, there are differences between them. The packaging, camera function, and menu navigation all appear the same. One of them has what appears to be an A/C charging port on the side, and the other one has a 3.5mm AUX output jack in that hole. The startup and shutdown images are different for each, as are the startup and shutdown sounds. **Update** After having used these slightly more, I will say there are significant differences between the two cameras, enough that I really only use one of them, and keep the other as a backup. The &#34;worse&#34; of the two has really poor brightness/contrast on the recordings to where you almost can't make things out, even in full daylight. The other major difference is the frame-rate. Again, the &#34;worse&#34; of the two seems to be at maybe 15fps making the video pretty jittery. The better one seems much closer to a typical 30 fps. One minor difference worth noting is that the menus of the worse one are also not as clear. They navigate the same way, but the function of each setting isn't very obvious.<br /><br />- Mounting bracket: Suction cup works GREAT. There have been a few people that have said that the ball joint won't hold the camera in place after you've messed with it too much. I experienced a similar issue, but then found that there is an adjustment nut that you can tighten down on the ball. I don't feel comfortable making it super tight for fear of it stripping out, but just snugging it down was enough to hold the camera still.<br /><br />- IR &#34;Night&#34; mode: It's stupid that they included this. The little IR LEDs on the front will not project any further than the middle of your hood.<br /><br />Anyone who has given these a poor rating either received a defective product or they're delusional about what $15 will buy. Build quality is horrible, but they work as advertised. I probably won't buy more of these once they stop working, but if you're like me and you're on the fence about owning a dash cam, these are a perfect way to get your feet wet and decide if you want to invest in a better one.", "images": [], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AETFG25GPHO7GXOLMNHCYWB7TCHA", "timestamp": 1435260390000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

Nope. It looks like a great video camera on the outside, because it is equipped with infrared light, and has a flip screen to preview/review the movies that you've recorded with this DVR. On the small flip screen, the movie files or pictures taken, look nice and nearly clear. HOWEVER...the bad part is where you view your video clips on your PC. When I view my movie videos with Windows Player, the whole thing is super blurry, the traffic light looks hazy, and you definitely cannot see the other driver's license plate without have to be approximately 3 feet away from the front vehicle.<br /><br />My Samsung Galaxy smart phone shoots way better quality pictures and crystal clear movie files than this so-called &#34;HD&#34; DVR. It's not way near HD quality.<br /><br />Another pet peeve about this DVR is that I have had LOTS and LOTS of trouble accessing the files on this DVR to my computer.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Cant go wrong here", "text": "Cons:  The plastic smells very \"Fruity\" upon arrival but dissipates after a few days.  If you use it for 2 hours straight, it may not come on next time you activate it.  Sometimes it will keep turning itself off and on until the battery power completely dies after you stop. Weird random noises sometimes show up in recordings and the clock runs much faster so every few weeks you have to dial it back a few minutes to keep the time accurate.  The Pros:  It's only like $23 with shipping plus $10-20 for an SD card (depending on the memory) It's great piece of mind driving around knowing if anything happens, you'll have it on video for the police, your insurance company and/or the other driver that hit you.  You don't get mad at bad drivers anymore, you're happy they just made your \"Worst drivers\" video compilation :)  It makes YOU a safer driver because you don't want to be caught on film pulling any \"Dukes of Hazard\" type maneuvers.

I agree with a lot of the reviews that say it does its job for the price.  This was extremely cheap and for $20, it was okay.  It seems that night time quality is going to be zero after dark unless you're in a major city.  I've tested it in HD day and night:  Day:  Awesome;  Night:  Almost worthless.  I live in a city with about 400,000 people so the streets are decently lit on main routes and you can barely see anything on this.  Absolutely worth the buy for daytime driving.  Good note:  It would NOT work memory wise until I was using something LARGER than 8GB SD.  I always made sure the mount was sturdy and not going to slide.  However, when I had an accident rear-ending someone at about 40 MPH with them slowing down for a stoplight, this thing went flying off the mount hook (the suction cup still on the windshield) and broke in half ruining the SD card.

My unit seems to work great but, it wouldn't surprise me if quality control varies widely across these units.<br /><br />One feature that I do like is how it turns on and off automatically with the car's ignition. This does depend on your vehicle however. On my Volvo, power to the outlet is cut when the ignition is turned off, so the camera uses it's internal battery to shut down after I remove my key.

To get into the menu turn it on and click menu button before it starts to record, menu comes up with 5 choices, click mode it comes up with 5 more choices, if you click down 6 times it will give you 5 more choices from the menu, click down 6 more times it will come to 2 more choices, click menu to clear out of the menu mode. Once you do it a few times you get the hang of it. The ok or record button is the one next to the power button.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "You Get What You Paid For", "text": "First off, this dash cam recorder does record, and it works well for what it is supposed to do. But at this price you aren't getting real HD, even though it says so in the title of the device and on the box it comes with. Also, you must know that it will not recognize any SD card higher (if there are any higher) than 32 Gigs. I tried different kinds of 64gig SD Cards and none would work, only my 32 gig cards. The device feels a bit cheap, at least the plastic it's made of does. And the screen seems a little cheap too, but again.. for the price I would say it's reasonable. If you need a dash cam and are very VERY limited in funds, this one isn't THAT bad. It does record and it does it okay. The video quality isn't amazing or pretty good, but you can see everything and make out stuff (honestly, its okay).. although at night, don't even try to have it recording as you won't see almost anything at all. It has infrared lights but they don't do much. At least not on the device I purchased. The one good thing that I liked was the car charger and it's cable.. it's LONG, and I was able to run it inside the car's interior panels and what not to power it up by my rear view mirror. I wouldn't recommend this if you are able to afford a good Dash cam, those that are way up there in price. Like a Top Dawg HD DVR Dash Cam or something similar, which costs about $120 I think. In any case, like I said. If you need one, and are low low in funds, this one should do the job.. although poorly, it will record what you need it to record. If you can put down a little over a hundred bucks, look for one that has good ratings, as I think they'll work far better than this one.", "images": [], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AGGLHXTFXTA34YXAXUFLNUE73MBA", "timestamp": 1389458990000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

Video quality is as the price been paid ($36.95). Just notice that it is not wide angle Lens after 1st try out. It has only 75-80 degree view. Don't mention IR function. It only works within couple feet but a great feature for ghost hunting or looking for UFO while driving. Using 1280x960 video mode to record video has not much different from lower pixels quality. Not much can complain with this great price. I will add one more star two weeks later if it has not broken down as other reviewer mentioned. Add to three stars when it survives the 1st month. Add to five stars if 6 months later it is still working. That will be a great deal as 5 bucks/month rent. Hope that will be the case.<br /><br />* an update * So far it works almost two weeks.  It's been upgraded to two stars now ! :-)<br />* 2nd update * It will meet one month milestone next week.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "So far, an excellent item for the price", "text": "I was in the market for a cheap DVR and the price fit the bill. Reluctant because of some reviews I held off and kept it on my wish list. I wasn't satisfied reading some folks got a product that only had Chinese menus, some got a product that quit working after 5 minutes of use, some got a product that was D.O.A. Well, then I read the reviews of folks who seemed to get a good model with English menus and was fully functional and recorded beautifully. For my birthday I was given a 25 dollar Amazon gift card and this was the first thing that came to mind (mind you, I was still very reluctant but figured if I got a dysfunctional model it would soften the blow of only 'wasting' 15 dollars) To my surprise the night of my birthday I get on to make the purchase to find the price was reduced! I purchased it immediately. Shipping was very fast as usual (thanks Amazon!) I opened it up the minute I received it and tried it out. I was happy to see the battery was fully charged and the item was packaged very well. Instructions and device menu was in English!! I had an 8gb sd card laying around so I popped it in. Today, on my way to work I used it for the first official time. I removed the sd card to find my 40 minute commute used a whopping 2.3 gb! That's pretty dissatisfying because I figured I could keep a few days' worth of driving on an 8 gig card. The video quality leaves a little to be desired but like I said for the price I'm not going to complain much. The audio is very good, however. It picks up voices from outside the vehicle, the turn signal (incase you ever need to prove you used it), etc etc. Overall, I say take a chance! Honestly you're more likely to waste your money buying McDonald's for lunch than taking a chance on one of these. It comes with a very nice, very long power cord (incase you would like to route it up through your moldings, dash, what have you.. for a nice clean appearance); a 3 foot usb cable ; and may I note the window suction mount is worth 20 dollars alone..you can mount anything with a threaded mounting hole.

Used every day on a dashboard mount as the suction cup will not hold on the windshield  (I think this is an issue with all suction mounts regardless of quality.  I have a Garmin GPS mount that does the same thing.  A little silicone adhesive on the cup seems to work)  The unit has  stood up pretty well under the Florida sun.  Battery compartment lid has loosened and has to be kept closed with scotch tape.  Today the unit stopped working but after some refitting of the 12v plug that goes into the unit it came back to life.  We'll see how long that lasts!

I don't need a camera that costs so much that I fear that it will be stolen or broken.  Has a semi wide fish-eye lens. I'm not looking for wedding photo quality, come on its only 25 bucks. Comes with car charger and suction cup mount, not mentioned in the description. Also comes with a cellphone type rechargeable battery. Plugged into the charger, I get over 9 hours of video (with audio) on a 16GB card. VGA quality is 640x480, so stay with that mode, because the other larger sizes that it records (D1, and SVGA) are actually not different at all. The SVGA 1280x720 is the same as the VGA and D1 680x480, but with thick black edges on the sides, video is not sharper. You may want to buy a different smaller sized window mount that has a \"ball hinge\". The mount that comes with it is somewhat large, but still fine to use. The charger wire is long enough to tuck under window trim and dashboard trim and reach the car's power socket. Not too bad at night time, so see the attached video sample that I made. The camera comes with infrared lights, but I see no use for them unless you are video recording your hood ornament, or if you use this device as a home security monitor inside of your house. Not a bad idea, just buy one of those 120volt wall adapters to plug your charger into, then attach the camera to a window or wall.

I've used it over a number of days with half a dozen class 10 cards, four class 6 cards, and five class 4 cards of varying storage capacity.

The instructions difficult to understand but I did manage to set the device after playing around with it. I charged the camera overnight and wanted to test it out the next day. To my disapointment, the camera couldn't even record the whole 20 min drive to work because the battery died. What a piece of junk. Additionally, in this modern era with HD and high tech smart phones, this camera is no where near HD quality. I couldn't even read street signs with this thing let along license plates. So I decided to return it. I was truly disappointed with this product even though I knew that it was only 20 bucks. I was determined to have a car cam and did much research but I could not find anything with good quality video in my price range. So after much thought, I started looking at phone apps that can do the same as this camera. To my surprise, there are so many apps out there that will act as a DVR. Like most phones these days, they actually have HD quality video. All i did was download a free app ( I like daily roads voyager) and I bought an iottie phone holder to attach to my winshield. Both work great and the videos are exactly what I wanted in a car cam. Dont waste you money on this cam. The iottie costs 20 bucks and you would only need to buy a sd or micro sd card if you wanted to store the videos on your phone.", "images": [], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AGPQUGHPMZGMWNRUUBBQKCYPGKGQ", "timestamp": 1374978671000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "pretty good dashcam", "text": "I've played with this thing a week now.  Not bad for an under $20.00 dash cam.  I was impressed with the quality of video it produced.  I'll list the things about it I don't like first.  You can't preview or watch the video from the cam.  You have to view it on your computer or laptop.  It doesn't come with a memory card, you have to buy one separate.  I bought the 32gig card like they suggest.  Didn't need that.  An 8 gig would have worked just as well.  Another thing, the infrared night vision apparently doesn't work well.  At least on mine, when I tried it at night, . It was dark as hell.  All I could see was what was in my headlights.  I'll mess with it some more after dark and see if it was something I want doing right.  If I was wrong, I'll repost what I did wrong.<br /><br />There are two buttons to use.  On/off, and record.  Plug the unit into an outlet, like your cigarette lighter outlet.  When you crank the vehicle the unit will automatically turn on and start recording.  Unless you are like me and your auto has an always on outlet, then you have to unplug the adapter each time.  The cord is long enough to hide it under the glove box and across the bottom of the windshield to keep it hidden.<br /><br />The setup was easy.  First throw the Japanese written instructions in the trash, then click then menu button to navigate through the options.  When you find an selection you want to change, hit the record button to change it.  The sound is good.  It records any sound you or your stereo makes.  I turned my sound off.<br /><br />It's lightweight, not very sturdy, so be careful with it.  Would I buy another or recommend this product to someone?  Yes.<br /><br />Don't forget, it has no card and it has no internal memory,  so you have to buy one to be able to record anything.", "images": [], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AGW4H5WZI7G2YXKJYPREWPHXJUNQ", "timestamp": 1388811645000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

When I received it I set it aside for a few months without even taking out of the box, that was a mistake.  When I took it out and finally powered it up the menu came up in Russian.  Being that I don't speak the language I had to go to Google translate to figure out how \"language\" looks in Russian, it took a little bit but finally got the menu to display in English. Once it was up and running I let it charge for awhile and took some test videos.  Quality and sound were decent for the price I paid for the unit.  I put it in the car and let it charge the first 2 day I was driving.  After that I unplugged and the battery indicator showed full. After a few minutes I heard a beep and saw the indicator had dropped to one bar and was flashing.  I plugged it in and the unit started charging. After a few minutes it showed full so I unplugged it, again the indicator fell to one bar and was flashing.  I noticed that when I plug it in it goes to full and stops charging, then when you unplug it goes to empty and dies.<br /><br />I still use the unit but it must be plugged in at all times which is annoying having a cord hang down from the windshield.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "For the price: Worth it.", "text": "Look, lets be honest. It's not the best Dash Camera money can buy. But for 17 bucks why/how could it be? CYA people. You don't have to have the best equipment money can buy. As long as it works.<br /><br />I bought it and a 32 GB Class 10 SD card (About 20 bucks) for it. I run it at least 10 hours straight. I just start recording at the beginning of my shift and let it run throughout the whole thing. I can get (Give or take) about 4 days or so of recording with it set on the lowest video setting (Which is all you need) before it starts overwriting the old files (Set to 5 Minute increments). (Note that the time is on Night Shift as well. It seems like once the sun comes up it takes more space. Possibly because there's more going on in the video). If you're right behind a car at night the license plate can get over exposed but everything else still comes in pretty good.<br /><br />As a suggestion: Buy a small USB card reader. Yes, for the most part the camera is plug and play with the computer but it never seems to install the way other (NAME BRAND) devices do. It also makes it easier to get video off in the middle of the shift without removing the camera from the windshield.<br /><br />My partners car was hit by a drunk driver while on a traffic stop. We (Our Department) do not provide dash cams but mine (This camera) was in an running nearby. Despite the driver being drunk, his defense was that he couldn't see my partners car. Since he plowed into the car by the time the supervisor arrived the electronics inside were turned off to make sure there was no fire hazard (Disabling the overhead lights). We work for a department that investigates EVERYTHING. All the arriving supervisor would have had to go on would have been my partners word that his overhead lights were on. But since I had the camera, there was Video Proof that his car had the overheads on (And they were working properly).<br /><br />NOTE: This product is NOT properly shielded from RF interference. If you are into HAM radios (or you work for a police department and use your handheld radio while inside the car) and key up your HT anywhere near this thing while its turned on it locks up. You can fix it by unplugging the power and removing the battery (Forcing it to turn off) then putting the battery back and plugging it back in. Then you've got to reset the time and date before you can start recording again. The wired mobile radio doesn't seem to effect it, but on HT it freaks it out. I have not tried a mobile using a magnetic mount antenna yet, only a mobile with the antenna mounted doesn't seem to effect it.<br /><br />Even with that issue, I still use the heck out of this camera. It's not a deal breaker. For 17 bucks even if you decide you want a better one down the road, this was your introduction to know if you like it or not.

Card is needed to function as camera's &#34;hard drive&#34;.  Looks EXACTLY like a camera I purchased previously elsewhere, but don't let looks deceive you.  There are apparently several flavors of this dash cam out there, with differing levels of quality in instructions, hardware quality, and firmware quality/options.<br /><br />The camera I previously purchased is VGA only, and is powered by a conventional power plug.  This camera, in contrast, uses the mini-USB port to charge the battery and transfer video.  The spot where the power plug is on my other camera is filled by a A/V OUT jack on this dash cam.  Neither features a HDMI jack.  This camera actually has rather comprehensive instructions in (microscopic) english - the other camera's instructions were scanty and barely comprehensible.  This camera had an easily-removable screen protector.  the other has a screen protector that &#34;took an act of Congress&#34; to remove, with a big bubble in it.  The (retail) boxes both cameras arrived in were identical, and both appeared to be brand-new.  While the window mounts are different, both should work fine (I've been using the other camera in my vehicles for over a month with no mount problems).<br /><br />The only problem I've encountered with my older dash cam is that the power plug sometimes works itself loose, Also - the previously-purchased camera cost almost twice as much, but is VGA only - this camera will go all the way to 1080P.<br /><br />Both cameras were easy to set up without the instructions, although you have to use the record button on the rear of both cameras as the enter button during setup.  I turned off the almost worthless IR LED's and audio record option on both cameras.  If you're moving, the headlights will illuminate the scene ahead.  The LED's will light only a few feet ahead, and the audio is nominal at best, and I'm hoping that with no audio, my file sizes will be smaller.<br /><br />So, I guess that what I'm trying to say is: your best chance of getting a good, cheap dash cam is to be mindful of what specific vendor the reviewer obtained their camera from, and purchase accordingly.  (I bought this one from EVER LIGHTING)  Again - be aware that I got 2 very different (internally) dash cams in identical boxes.

People are saying...you get what you pay for when it comes to the price of this dash cam and the quality of video. I have to disagree.

One of my main issues with these camera's is that there are no company name or brand on them so that they can be recommended to users on here who are looking for a better quality dash cam from such a cheap price. I'll keep these 2 HD DVR cam's for spares but....the other 3 that I have will be used in my vehicles. Do your research and watch the video's of the different dash cams to see what they're truly like.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Great Price but Not As Advertized", "text": "I would have given this Five Stars if the item description was accurate.<br /><br />First of all, the item sent to me is a USED product.  I wouldn't even call it refurbished judging from the plastic bags the pieces were wrapped in.  I even had to fish a small nut for the mount from the box that had come loose.  It had obviously been opened and used at least once, probably more since the bags looked pretty hammered.  All they had to do was include the word &#34;Refurbished&#34; in the product description and do a better job of repackaging and I wouldn't be dinging for this.  In fact I would have felt better about buying it for the seemingly unbelievably low price if it was listed as a refurbished product.<br /><br />Secondly, it is advertized as &#34; Recording resolution:1280x960 / 720x480 / 640x480 pixels&#34;.  This is not true.  It only has one size, labeled &#34;VGA&#34; in the setup, which is 640x480.  The box it came in says &#34;HD DVR&#34; and most people interpret HD as High Definition.  The instructions (which were obviously written by someone who doesn't speak English) says you can change the video size in the settings menu but it only has one option -- VGA.<br /><br />Thirdly, the description also says it has &#34;120 degree wide view angle&#34;.  Perhaps if it actually did allow you to record in 1280x960 resolution this might be true but since it doesn', this is also a false statement.<br /><br />It does, technically, have IR LED for night recording.  You turn it on by clicking the on/off button which switches between Day and Night mode (hold it in to turn off/on). But the IR LED light only works for objects within a few feet of the camera.  Only a very dim and narrow beam actually reaches the hood of my car making this feature worthless.<br /><br />The instructions must have been for a different model or firmware since the settings described in the manual don't match what is actually available on the menu.  For example, it says there is an option for IR LED that can be switched between &#34;Atuo or Off&#34; (type-o included).  But this option doesn't exist.<br /><br />Having said all this, I wasn't expecting much for $15.  Even though the video is only 640x480 you can read the license plate of the car in front of you while waiting at a signal.  Once cars gets much beyond that, plates are unreadable.  The mount is very secure and the power adapter has enough length that I could hide it by tucking it between the windshield and the roof at the top, the door weather stripping and column on the side and up under the dash, still reaching the power outlet under the center of my dashboard.  I also put the wire coming down from the top of the dash in with the wires to my rear view mirror which are covered so there are no noticeable wires.<br />It has a &#34;Voice Record&#34; mode that will record your voice as long as there is no other ambient sound.  But if you have the radio on or a loud cabin fan blowing all it records is static.  So I just set it to not record sound since it's worthless unless you want to record dictation or something.<br /><br />It requires an SD card to record (not included) so be sure to purchase one if you don't already have one.  It says it supports cards up to 32GB.  I use a 32GB card and it works fine.  One advantage of lower resolution is it won't take up as much memory space so you should be able to use a much smaller card unless you want to record a 10+ hour road trip.<br /><br />It can be set to record in 2, 5 or 15 minute increments (with a few seconds lost between segments).  It can also be set to just record continuously until it's turned off.  I think the only disadvantage of this is that when it needs to free up space it deletes old files which would mean losing an entire trip.  I think it's better to do that than lose a few seconds that might be critical footage.<br /><br />If you want high quality recording you'll probably want to pay more and get a better dash cam.  But this seems like a cheap entry level camera that will help you decide if you really want or need a more expensive device later.", "images": [], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AEOUMQJX3BEPHXJEHDYNY27TOYIQ", "timestamp": 1431791526000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true}

After overcoming that hurdle, this thing works great.  Records a great picture with or without sound using the default 1080 picture setting.  You can set how long each video segment is (1/2/3/5/10 min),  This will break your trip into files for playback and when you run out memory it overwrites the oldest file on the card with a new one.

My basic expectations were not met and I'm not going to waste my time arguing with the seller or evem calling them. First, If you purchase this product, you might as well also get a Mini Usb car charger, cuz the one included doesn't work. I asume this is for most people since other reviewers of this same item, or the same item listed elsewhere on Amazon has similar issues.<br /><br />People are also correct about the HD recording. Its only like 12 frames a second or something. I saw it once transferred to my PC and its like watching pic,pic,pic, instead of video. The DL or whatever (the one below HD) is much smoother, but you lose definition, no street sign words viewable or liscence plates. I havent used this at night yet so who knows.<br /><br />So anyways, I use the mini USB charger for my cell phone and plug it into this. I use it on D1 or dl recording mode and all it well. Others mentioned that these stop working or something after a week or two. If it does, the trashcan this will go, and I'll by a brand name next. UMM.. there's a slot for HDMI cable, but its only the impression in plastic, no actual slot. UMM, 2.4 inch screen... makes a big difference to a 2.5 which is almost a centimeter off. So they should just be honest and say its 2.4 in. Um, the battery does charge and works for about 2 hours without the Mini USB car charger plugged in.<br /><br />update: 9/13/2011 ITS IN THE GARBAGE!! stopped working this morning. The videos becan recording like the old tv channels used to come in with house antennas that were positioned wrong. It was crazy. I reset the battery afterwords with zero effect. I also noticed the thing no longer worked without the car charger plugged in aswell. So I wasted money again on a dvr dash cam. I'm fed up. I'm gunna buy a 200 dollar one after this review.

Removing the film is a little hard and I was worried that it might be a fold in the LCD film.  No Instructions of course.  So if you see a small green square in the top left corner of the LCD screen this is where you can carefully grab or use tweezers to pull the protective film off.  That said for the price the camera does a decent job.  I mounted it just below the mirror and ran the wires around the head liner and down the windshield column, under the dash to the cigarette lighter socket.  My wife got into the truck and didn't even notice it.  Currently have a 32GB stick installed.  It is fairly easy to pop the SD card out and check the videos on your computer.  Media player classic home cinema had a problem but MS media player worked good.<br />Video is good enough for the price.  I set resolution at 720.

My eye-fi couldn't pick up my wifi network so I had to upload manually which took forever.<br /><br />This is a neat unit if all you're going to do is use a 32gb sd card and rotate cards every day.<br /><br />It's better than my previous unit but there's plenty room for improvement.<br /><br />I don't recommend leaving it switched on in the car as it and the cigarette plug get very hot - maybe hot enough to cause a fire<br /><br />UPDATE<br />This was purchased in 2012.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Also had the blurry problem, but kind of found a solution", "text": "The setup of the camera was very easy.  Turns on and starts recording, shuts off when you turn off the car (assuming you have a switched outlet, of course).  The 1280 x 720 setting is a lie, it looks worse than 640 x 480 and probably takes up more space.  All 1280 x 720 does is chop off the top and bottom of the 640 x 480 image.  In other words, you capture less of what's going on outside.  Mine was working fine for the first 3 minutes, with my wife driving.  When I later drove, it immediately became blurry.  Over the next few days, I would wrestle with it, tapping it to make it focus, but it would only last a few seconds.  I then realized it was becoming blurry when I accelerated (I guess I drive more aggressively than my wife), and cleared up when I would hit the brakes.  What I did was to aim the camera a little more downward, so I could see the hood more, and that has helped a lot.  It seems like the lens inside are loose, and are working when there is pressure pushing them to the front of the camera and not the back.<br />Still, it is defective so I'm returning it, but I'll give it 2 stars because it was so cheap.  I'll keep ordering and returning until I get a good one.  I don't want something expensive hanging in my windshield, and it's a little tough to dismount it and remount it, so I'll stick with something cheap and not $50.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />By the way, the review above was from a seller named fastNeasy.<br /><br />While returning the first one, I ordered another from FAR CLOUD.  I got it today.  It looked the same, but the software running on it was completely different.  It has more options in some places, and less in the others.  It was looking real good, like it wasn't going to have issues with the focus.  But before I could install it in the car, it suddenly shut off, and now will not power back on.  I guess it's going back as well.  I plan to order a third from this seller because I liked the software running on this one.  Watch me get one with a 3rd type of software running on it, heh.  I'll post back with the results.<br /><br />Since Amazon is paying for the return shipping, and I have a UPS drop box on the way to work, I can do this all day.  Bring it on!  I'll keep ordering until I get one that works.<br /><br />***UPDATE 2***<br /><br />Alright, that 2nd cam did power back on the next day, so I decided not to return it.  Being pleased with FAR CLOUD's camera, I ordered a 2nd one, and when I got it, I returned the original blurry camera back to fastNeasy.  So now I'm set with dash cams in both of my cars.

As for this, I will keep it on my new car for now (it's better than nothing).", "images": [], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AHB7NZC5CG6JX2AUN2FWU6JVWTZQ", "timestamp": 1373595021000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

So it payed for its self in that way!<br /><br />Things to note about this camera. Its not really a wide angle lens. I want to say its more like a 120mm, Depending how wide your car is you might have to place the camera directly in the center of your windshield.<br /><br />The battery will only last for a good 2 hours.

I read the negative reviews and decided that for that price, it was still worth the risk.<br /><br />Does it work.  Yes it does.  It records quite well and has lots of features including motion detection and night time recording.<br /><br />Does it work like it should... no.  After just a week, one day in the heat caused the lens to dislocate and blur.  So, now my recordings are not nearly as detailed.  Can you still see everything, yes.  Can you read a license plate or get fine details for the video.... no.  Apparently, you can fix the camera (lots of reviews with those who have and give detailed instructions)... I just haven't gotten around to trying it.<br /><br />Now, after a few weeks, I find that the battery no longer works.  This means the camera cannot function without the car being on and that the date/time reset each time I stop/start the car.<br /><br />I wanted to try this camera out as an experiment.  I knew it was a faulty product (from the reviews) going into it and had low expectations.  That being said, I'm pleased with the fact that it actually DOES work but still disappointed that it's no longer clear and crisp video.  And, for the cost of a meal, it was worth the investment, even if it might be a short one.<br /><br />I think it's always a good idea to have a camera in this day in age with insurance scams, road rage, etc.  If you're THINKING to try out a dashcam, I'd say this is a good starter.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "old web camera video quality (in daylight), rubbish audio quality", "text": "I have been using this dash camera for about two weeks now. For what it is and how cheap it is, it is good. I can't complain for something that is only $21 dollars. It automatically records when the car is started (as long as the power is plugged in), deletes old recordings as new videos are shot, automatically shuts off when power is cut, and is fairly small and unobtrusive and comes with it's own window mount.<br /><br />The video quality is actually quite poor by today's standards but it's a dash camera and doesn't need to be amazing. It's okay in daylight. Pretty much just black if you're driving at night without street lights on the road. Barely registers my own vehicles' headlamps unless they are shining on something other than the road. It's better if there are street lights and other traffic during night footage.<br /><br />The audio quality is just terrible. I don't know if there is a problem with mine or not, but when i was testing it out in the house when I first got it, it constantly records a very annoying loud noise that doesn't exist. Subsequently, audio while driving has to be louder than the imaginary noise to register on the videos. I'm always blaring my radio so you can hear that, but being quiet or speaking soft around it just sounds like loud noise.<br /><br />There is also a constant defect or something that shows up in the audio on the videos every few seconds. Almost like a split second of radio static every few seconds.<br /><br />The camera has a full-size sd slot. I purchased a 16 GB card for it. It fills up pretty quickly. I do maybe three or four hours of driving a week, commuting and a few other minor trips here and there. It currently has only a week and a half of footage on the camera and it's full. But as I mention earlier, it automatically deletes old footage for storage of the new. If you want more of a buffer, however, I recommend you get the largest capacity this camera will support (32 GB). I personally find the 16 GB works just fine.<br /><br />This camera claims to have a 270 degree fish-eye lens. I am not entirely convinced but I have no way of proving it does or not. I have footage, but I have no idea how to submit it for reference with this review. It's mounted at the top of my truck's window, and it can't see both corners of the hood.<br /><br />The mount functions great. Very similar to any gps or phone suction cup window mount, but just with a camera screw mount point for the dash camera.<br /><br />For something so cheap, I think it functions great. I believe that for its intended purpose the quality is decent.

The other driver was at fault, and I had no video to prove it. Fortunately, the insurance company came to the same conclusion based on forensics of the damage, but the whole experience made me realize that the single most important characteristic of a dash cam is **reliability**.<br /><br />Other characteristics such as price and video quality mean nothing if I cannot count on the camera to always be recording and saving video.

I will be able to use it for something, if not as dashboard camera. And it is cheap. That's why it gets two stars.<br /><br />However, this is just a cheapo Chinese copy of the camera I was looking for. That one I bought somewhere else on the internet about 6 months ago. I was satisfied with it, and wanted to buy a second one for the other car. Then I run into this cheapo copy. Its price is about 1/3 of the real one. It looks exactly the same. However, it is not the same. Its field of view is much less and it doesn't record in real HD. The quality of this piece of junk is below VHS. You can set the recording quality in the menu up to 1280x960 but I believe this is just interlacing of a 360x240 image. The CMOS image sensor light sensitivity is poor and it becomes grainy in lower light conditions.<br /><br />Don't buy. Look elsewhere. Pay real dollars for a real camera.<br /><br />Update: I used it for one day. The sound is distorted, unintelligible. The field of view is the same as a 50mm objective with a small film camera, no way \"wide\". You can't see the traffic lights in front of you: how you can argue you passed in yellow? The image quality is terrible: you can't read the license plate of the car directly in front of you, except when you stand right behind with a few feet gap. The capital letters of overhead directional signs are legible only when you pass \"under\" them, of course as permitted by the poor field of view.<br /><br />This camera worth about $20, not much more and don't expect to measure up with the original, identically looking real HD camera that is called Trek View.

Since my car turns on and off power the cigarette lighter with the ignition, it's all automatic -- perfect.<br /><br />-- these videos do show what happened and when.<br /><br />-- even at night you can see cars, lights, etc.<br /><br />And the bad --<br /><br />-- build quality is quite low.  Though given the price, this is not unexpected.  It's low, but adequate.<br /><br />-- I'm still investigating, but the 12v power supply seems to create a lot of RF noise.  When on, my GPS seems to have a problem picking up a signal, and it might be responsible for my TPMS light coming on (it came on shortly after I installed the DVR, and I need to see if it'll turn off after a while of not using the DVR.)  TPMS is RF based, and it happened at the same time as the GPS and when the DVR was installed -- so that's why I suspect it.  Still not sure.<br /><br />I may need to find another power supply, or add ferrite beads or something.  Or maybe it's just a coincidence, I don't know yet.<br /><br />And the ugly --<br /><br />-- video quality is *extremely* low.  A $12 808 #3 keychain camera at 640x480 has better video quality.<br /><br />During the day, everything is washed out -- it's too bright.  You can see the road, cars, signs, etc. but if there's a car stopped right in front of you, the odds are very good that you won't be able to make out its license plate even under those ideal conditions.<br /><br />At night, things actually improve a bit.  You can make out the road, cars, signs, etc. (as long as they are illuminated by your lights, of course) and you probably can make out the license plate of a car right in front of you.  (But if it never stops in front of you, and you never get 3 feet behind it?  Forget it.)<br /><br />Strangely enough, the quality of the image in the display actually seems somewhat higher than that saved to the SD card.  I'm going to have to test it using the AV out cables and using it as a webcam to see if that makes a difference.<br /><br />In any event, if there's a \"he said, she said\" situation in a collision, this video will probably show what happened.  But if there's a hit and run or something, it probably will *not* catch a clear picture of a driver or their license plate, even under ideal conditions.<br /><br />Considering how cheap it was ($22), I don't think I'll be sending it back.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "5 stars because I quickly got what I wanted.", "text": "Excellent purchase. Best price for what you're looking for, if you're looking for a new man-toy to utilize on a budget. If you want green screen night vision recording, this isn't the one. I got what I wanted though. Delivered sooner than it was anticipated, instructions are botched in proper &#34;Engrish&#34; fashion, but that validates its authenticity. And the instructions ARE readable and able to be understood,  provided you have a brain regularly used for thinking. Yet - I must reiterate - they are in ENGRISH; a.k.a. the grammatically incorrect form of the English translation of a beautiful Asian language (There are other languages the instructions provide). I digress; It captures a healthy field of view, though I cannot tell exactly how wide it is. When I say &#34;healthy&#34; I mean it will capture the color of the light at the intersection at the top of the screen, your vehicle hood just barely at the bottom of the screen, and the sides are proportionate to that. The 270 degree whirl part is to describe the screen that flips down to display what the camera is capturing. I originally thought it was a 270 degree field of capture, like a fisheye lens. I think I'd have to get something with an actual &#34;fisheye&#34; lens. Regardless, it has enough settings in it to document any traffic accident with ease. You can change recording duration, video quality, and the option to record video, capture images (and change all settings about that process) and record only audio. Then you can play all of that back. The only downside is the battery life. Do the initial charging processes before tripping out about it. But I keep my charger plugged in or nearby most of the time if the battery is going. It's more than likely my settings that are causing a faster battery drain... Or I'm accidentally leaving it on sometimes.<br /><br />Regardless - a great buy. Master the settings with your brainpower and hands-on experience, and you will have a fun and useful tool with you. Almost making you want to dare traffic to screw with you... But be careful about that because it goes both ways.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Doesn't Always Work", "text": "Like a lot of people, I was looking to purchase a dash camera to have in case of an insurance incident in order to prevent fraud and any subsequent rate increases. Seeing as I had never purchased a dash camera before, I had no idea where to begin. There are hundreds of listings that all have a very wide range of prices - featuring HD recording, non-HD recording, HDMI outputs, different resolutions, and etc. Needless to say, I was confused. Though, one thing was for sure: I was not going to spend a lot of money on a  camera, especially seeing as I wanted to get one just to try out and see if I could get the hang of having one around in my car.This is where this camera caught my attention: For a sub-twenty dollar price range, this camera seemed to have some decent features, even for an entry-level or &#34;knockoff&#34; model. So, I decided to purchase it. And this is where my experience began.<br /><br />First off, I must admit that the shipping was very quick from this particular seller (Dowson). I opted for standard shipping and received it in what seemed to be a matter of two days or so. A very nice bonus. Upon arrival, I opened up the packaging and started the un-boxing process by looking at the contents and checking to see if everything was there. It was, so I continued. Eventually, I got to the camera and when I inspected it there was a problem: the screen has a noticeable line going through it, almost as if it was dropped or nicked with some sort of box cutter during the production or assembly process. While it doesn't affect the device's operation, it still can prove to be very annoying. Some sort of clear sticky tape solution was over the screen (a screen protector, perhaps?) and when I tried to remove it (I thought that it was just a protective layer of film to guard against any more dings or scratches), it would not come off. In fact, the glue and sticky residue from this film was so stubborn that I was afraid to permanently damage the screen if I continued. So, I didn't.<br /><br />After the screen fiasco, I went ahead with bringing all of these things outside to my car to see how (or if) the camera worked. After inserting my SD card (I used an older 2GB one that I formatted, as the 16GB one that I ordered off of Amazon was arriving the next day) I powered on the camera and cycled through the menu items. Then, I hit record. And ... nothing happened. It seemed as if the camera had recorded around three seconds of video and froze. I could still see a live feed of video coming onto the LCD display, but it would not record. I pulled out the rechargeable battery and replaced it; still to no avail.<br /><br />Moving on to the next day, I tried the new SD card and the device seemed to work. I managed a fairly long (fifteen minute) recording session and when I reviewed the driving footage it looked good. The on-board battery had died so I removed it and plugged in the car charger that they supplied with the device in hopes that I could record some more footage. I hit the power button again, and the device proceeded to do a number of strange things. It made a &#34;popping&#34; sound (similar to the sound that an audio auxiliary cable makes when you touch it with your finger), the screen went on, faded to white, and froze to the point where all I could see were multi-colored stripes. To try and fix it, I unplugged the USB car charger and let it sit for a few minutes. But, after plugging it back in, it only worked for a few seconds and went through the motions of getting stuck at a multi-colored stripe screen. Very frustrating.<br /><br />Over all, this dash camera seemed to have some good recording capabilities and the quality was not all that bad. I know that the camera wasn't of the highest quality - especially for this price range - but all I wanted was for it to work properly. Is that too much to ask?", "images": [], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AHNZCNGQ6LRSRLOAJCTNNEC3RNAQ", "timestamp": 1381589874000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great cheap dashcam", "text": "I bought this dashcam to put in my car as a 'just in case'. It was cheap enough to justify the purchase and I figured why not. The dashcam feels and looks pretty cheap, but is exactly what I expected. It does it's job and is virtually maintenance free. I turn on my car, the camera turns on and starts recording. I turn off my car, the camera turns off. The menu is a bit wonky but once you figure out that you have to use the top two buttons to select things and not the buttons right under the screen, it's fine. Capture quality is pretty mediocre, however it's good enough. It's just as good as those youtube videos. You are able to distinguish cars and you'll be able to see the license plates of cars right in front of you. Good enough for me.<br /><br />The dashcam will automatically delete the oldest video files and you can set how large you want chunks to be (I set mine to 5 minutes). The IR LEDs are pretty useless unless you're up close. It also keeps track of date and time as long as you don't remove the battery (comes with a flat lithium battery). My dashcam also came with a very very obnoxious beep, which I don't think you can disable. I ordered another one to put in my other car and this 'beep' was far better and actually bearable. I ended up opening the first one and cutting the speaker wires so now it's totally silent. The power button pulsates a dim blue when it's recording. You can also disable the recording of sound so no one will be able to hear my terrible taste in music and my singing.<br /><br />On the highest video setting, my 8gb SD card was able to hold about 4 hours of footage.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great value and does it's job.", "images": [], "asin": "B0053DDNW6", "parent_asin": "B0053DDNW6", "user_id": "AH3RI67LJT67B2DMJZKZT5B3IJ7A", "timestamp": 1348602782000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Worth the $30", "text": "I've had this dash cam installed in my car for about 2 months now.  It does come up a bit short on quality, but it certainly does the basic job, and for $30...that's not bad.  The angle isn't as wide as I would have liked, but not as bad as some say, at least in my eyes anyway.  You can only read the license plates if a car is within a foot or two of your bumper, and the lighting is right.  You wouldn't be able to pick someone out of a police line up if you only had the dash cam to go by.  Also at night, it will only pick up what is in your headlights.  However, you could easily tell that someone cut you off, ran a stop sign, brake jammed you etc.  You could also tell that a high school kid ran out in front of you without looking like a 2 year old, which is the main reason I bought this as this nearly happened to me, but luckily I'm a good driver and braked in time as I am always extra cautious when kids are around.  I have mine set to 1 min loops and get about an hour of driving out of the 4 GB card I'm using on the lowest setting, as I found there was minimal difference in the quality settings.  Also as other have said there are different models being shipped as mine has no option to turn off the audio (poor quality anyway, so you cant make out a typical conversation).

Just insert the memory card (16GB works fine for me) and install it in the car.  It will start up and start recording right away in three minute segments.  It's a five volt system so don't try to wire it straight to the car's power system as 12 - 15 volts will fry it.  I installed a second cigarette lighter under the dash and ran the wire under the panel to make it a neater installation.  I recommend using the Pico 0956PT 10 Amp ATM Mini Blade Fuse Add-A-Circuit Fuse Holder (or similar) to add the circuit.  Then you can use the supplied power supply to plug into the newly installed cigarette lighter.  Like some others the only reason I didn't give it a five star rating is the poor instructions.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A good car camera - especially for the price.  Works fine.", "text": "I bought 3 of these, and they work great.  I can't believe they were so cheap.  I paid more for the 32 GB class 10 memory card than the cost of one camera.  I used the included suction mount to locate it behind my rearview mirror. That way I don't lose any visibility out of my windshield.  It has a lever that really sticks it to the windshield firmly.  I only flip down the viewing screen while pointing the camera, so from the drivers seat, you can't hardly even see the camera located behind the rearview mirror. The camera mount has a ring that you rotate to lock the camera into precisely the correct position, and it holds fast.  I ran the included power adapter cable up over the passenger side sun visor, down the post beside the windshield (attached with a few small pieces of double sided grey tape to match my cars interior), and then taped the rest up under the dash.  I just leave the power cord plugged into the cigarette lighter - so when I start the car the camera comes on automatically.  When you turn off the car - the camera stores the video and shuts off the camera.  You know when the camera comes on or off because it plays a little music clip. The &#34;user manual&#34; is very brief. The user manual is in English, and I think Chinese.  It is pretty cryptic, so before mounting it in the car, you just need to sit down with the camera in hand, and play with it until you are comfortable.  The included battery looked pretty cheap, but it works.  I only paid about $15 per camera, so I don't mind, and my camera is always running on the car charger anyway.  I have not viewed the video from nighttime recordings, but daytime is fine.  Looks like it records to an AVI file.  I believe it is supposed to record 8 hours of video on my class 10 32 Gig card, and then begin overwriting the oldest video first.  I think the class 10 card is recommended.  As long as you don't need super sharp video at distance, I recommend these little cameras.

However, after I got it I was very disappointed for the following reasons.<br />1. (and most importantly) the video is in 19 second chunks, with a 3-5 second gap in between each file.  A lot can happen in 3-5 seconds, and I don't like having big gaps in the recordings.<br />2.  The instructions are vague.  It tells you what each button is, and some basic functionallity, but does not go into detail, and I still can't figure out how to operate it properly.  The navigation through the menus is awkward and it is obvious the instructions were written by someone with limited English language skills.  I just have to keep pushing buttons till it turns off, or take out the battery.<br />3.  The field of view is narrow.<br />4.  The swivel on the mounting arm is flimsy, and I can't get it to tighten down so the whole unit does not move when I open/close the video screen.<br />5.  A little big for a dash cam.  It's about the size of a radar detector and takes up a lot of area on the windshield.<br />6.  The battery does not last very long.<br />7.  Misleading description as far as &#34;auto start&#34;.  It doesn't tell you that you have to hard-wire it into the ignition for this feature to work.<br /><br />On the positive side, it does take pretty good video and audio; you can replay the files right on the device; and the suction cup mount works pretty well, less the swivel tightening portion.<br /><br />I am overall disappointed with this product and am actively looking for a better model.

The video is clear when reviewed, it came set up for English language, and it worked reasonably well.<br /><br />The only complaint I had was that the SD card occasionally shakes it's way lose of it's contacts, without actually popping its door out, so I needed to pay attention to the recording indicator to determine whether the SD card had worked its way lose and I needed to reseat it to get it recording again.<br /><br />The SD card slot itself relies on the tension of its door to hold it against it's contacts, with a spring providing pressure to pop the card out when the door is opened.  There is no separate catch for the SD card, and the door itself is has a very weak latch.<br /><br />I was happy, considering the price, with this issue.  Unfortunately, although it first appeared about a week after I purchased this, it happened more and more often over the following 4 weeks.  Now, 39 days after purchase, the door itself no longer stays closed.  Whenever I attempt to seat the SD card, the door doesn't catch, immediately popping open again, unseating the SD card as it does.  It makes this otherwise well designed dashcam completely nonfunctional.<br /><br />I gave it two stars since issues were expected.  This is a VERY cheap dashcam and I originally purchased this assuming it wouldn't last very long.  I wanted to use it to determine whether or not I wanted to purchase a more expensive option or have no dashcam at all.

This still happens occasionally I will get a white screen and I will take the battery out and putt it back in and the unit will return to normal operation. There is a small blue line that goes through the screen which appears to be an manufacturers defect, however it does not impede my view. My only complaint is the audio is horrible but this is not a major concern since I am mostly concerned with capturing video of an incident not audio. I have been using it for about two weeks without any major problems. I am however skeptical how long the unit will last, you can tell that is made with cheap materials which came as no surprise for what I paid for it.
