I'm pretty tech savvy, so this was highly annoying.  Finally, I got it connected regularly and you can see the results in my photos.  The first is on my phone, connected directly to my wireless router, sitting about 6' away from it (no walls or anything between us).  The 2nd is with my phone, connected to this piece of crap, sitting in the same spot and only about 2' from the extender.  I wasn't expecting it to be the same Mbps as my router, but a drop of nearly 80% seems outrageous.  When I checked my son's computer - upstairs and through several walls and why I bought the extender - the speed through our wireless and the extender were about the same.  Even when I moved the extender to a plug in front of the doorway going upstairs so there would be no walls between the router + extender OR the extender + his laptop.  The only difference is that the extender drops its connection every 15-20 minutes, making for a very frustrating user experience.

First during setup, the MAC address that showed at setup on the computer screen was different than the one on the sticker on the unit. That seemed strange. Second, once setup, the distance from the router to this unit was limited to about 20 feet to maintain a \"Green\" light on the unit. The signal was not increased at the TV when the unit was functioning. During setup, I noticed that I had 7 wired units in my \"Connected\" list in the router. As the day went on, evidently this unit removed the wired units from that router connected list. That meant that any other device that was not connected by WiFi in addition to being wire connected, failed. I also noticed that the icon on the computer task bar went from a computer icon to a WiFi icon which was again, strange. The reason I noticed the wired device falling off the list was that I was watching a different TV when it failed, due to lost signal. The troubleshooting found the devices removed from the wire connected list in the router. I removed this device and \"Reconnected\" all the other wired devices and with several \"reboots\" thing came back to normal. The furthest TV still has a very weak signal, so I will have to find another way to fix the problem. This is the second extender device I have tried. The other one would not allow a network name with spaces. My network name has 3 words separated by spaces. Not going thru the trouble of renaming everything...", "images": [], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AH5DBUWSFHHXWL6BKNFPMMWOE2ZQ", "timestamp": 1651067310545, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

For the newbie, it is as easy as plugging the extender to an AC outlet, pressing the WPS button in your main router and another WPS button on the extender. But, yes: there are some tech heads among us that demand to get \u201cunder the hood\u201d of any gadget. Guess what? You can login to the extender via your web browser of choice to tweak things \u2013 or just presume that you know how they work. At any rate, both ways of setting it up are user friendly for each kind of audience. And its 2 antennas can be rotated 180 degrees each, just in case you are as obsessive with catching your main router's WiFi signal as I am with Digital TV antennas to get the strongest signal with the most channels.<br />Do you have in a far corner of your home a computer, game console or video disk player that won't connect to your network unless it can connect with an Ethernet cable? No problem! The EX6120bWiFi Extender has one Ethernet port. So, you can have WiFi AND Ethernet in a place 'far, far away' from your main router within your house. I tried it with a desktop PC connected by Ethernet, several WiFi devices and it ran a windows update download, rebooted and then... the Ethernet port stopped working! Tryouts with other PC and cable didn't work: the Ethernet port failed.<br />Now, don't try playing wise guy or wise girl by trying to connect via WiFi more devices that it is recommended to support, specially if you use one of those devices for teleconferencing (\u201cZOOM, TEAMS, anyone, anyone?\u201d). This device won't make your WiFi network run faster or better if your main router and / or internet provider's service level subscription has limitations (remember the last time your favorite interstate highway suddenly got all lanes jammed and you though that the next exit will take you to your place faster?). So, if you see a \u201cinternet connection is unstable\u201d message during teleconferencing with an application like ZOOM, you may need to compromise between dining out weekly each month or paying for an upgrade to your internet service that allows at least 20 MBPS. A WiFi extender won't make the cut.<br />Sometimes, you may convince your significant other to relocate your main router in a better location to broadcast your WiFi or may get a Router upgrade that can actually extend the signal reach out. But, for those of us who can't, the NETGEAR EX6120 is a good alternative with an extensive WiFi reach.<br />All photos (c) 2021 by reviewer.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/813NX2tBCnL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/813NX2tBCnL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/813NX2tBCnL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81NsBoERxmL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81NsBoERxmL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81NsBoERxmL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81k8EWCgraL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81k8EWCgraL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81k8EWCgraL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AG6VEK6DKFRUAFVVU57T3BDR3ZLA", "timestamp": 1631765966628, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": true}

Wait for the flashing light to turn green.<br />Push the WPS button, clearly labeled. When it's ready push the WPS button on your modem. Wait a minute or two then go to your WIFI settings, I used my smart phone which has 2 security apps running, and when prompted click the NETGEAR_EXT then put in your password.<br />I needed it for my mancave/shop outback. Works fantastic!!<br />Dropped service one time while I was on vacation but all I had to do was push factory reset and it reset in a matter of seconds.<br />Be sure to register your device with NERGEAR and get 90 days tech support. They emailed me right away when it had lost signal.<br />BTW;<br />If you install yourself there is a scam you'll get if you get an error code. Mine showed as Ohio n the guy walked me thru setup n said he'd have to transfer me tech support but it would cost 89.90. I said forget it I'll return it. Then he said could I pay 60.00?

We recently switched our internet to use a Verizon Jetpack hotspot, and this extender provides a nice boost to that signal.<br /><br />I did encounter some issues in setting it up, however. In following Netgear's procedure, Typing in the URL to access the firmware, it initially appeared to work.  I signed into my hotspot router to obtain the IP address of the extender and then was able to access it directly through that address to learn about a firmware update which I successfully downloaded and installed.  However, upon subsequently trying to use Netgear's procedure, I obtained a warning from my Chrome browser that I was trying to access an unsafe site..<br /><br />To make a long story short, after some Google searches, I learned from a Netgear site that this occurs because they have programmed their firmware to be accessed from the browser AS IF it is a website, and recent changes to Chrome and some other browsers are not able to validate a security certificate for that URL so they are interdicting the access to prevent a security breach, which, of course, isn't actually a concern because you're not really accessing an external website at all.  On their site, Netgear provided instructions on how to proceed to get around this false warning issue, and then I was able to access the device to make changes etc.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't see any information on this in the box or in the online users manual I downloaded, so it took some time to sort out.  It was a bit frustrating at the time, but now looking back, I see it as a minor inconvenience given how wonderfully this extender has been working for us.

The current experience is nowhere near the same.<br /><br />The UI is unresponsive, full of glitches and errors.<br /><br />First off, it forces you to create an account if you want to configure it with the web ui. You must enter your email, password, and choose \"security questions\" such as \"what was your first Netgear purchase\".<br /><br />Gone are the days when you have a locally served easy to use and functional page without revealing your email ID to the company. (It does offer a WPS install, but it seems that's just to tick off the \"easy to install\" category. I want to be able to configure this manually.)<br /><br />On this page you'll see irrelevant advertisement, e.g. Netgear Web Analytics that I have nothing to do with.<br /><br />The configuration for 5G can't select the channel automatically. You have to choose something from the drop-down. Can't tell if this is a problem with the hardware or the UI.<br /><br />Then Netgear pops up a message warning you to not set the SSID (name of network) same as your router - without clearly explaining why. (Perhaps it's because they know the quality of the extender is poor, and it will drag down the whole network with it if we do that?)<br />This essentially means they recommend you to add the new network to every device your have in your house. And if some of them only support one network, good luck.<br /><br />Finally the range itself is horrible. The router I wanted to extend actually allows more stable connection than the extender, irrespective of where I place the extender.<br /><br />----<br /><br />Update -<br /><br />My original review was primarily about the user interface.

The device will connect fine, but never gets an IP address and therefore cannot access any other devices on the LAN or Internet. The 2.4 GHZ Wi-Fi works fine. Reading reviews and forums, this seems to be a known problem that has never been fixed.

One thing to be aware of is that the device creates a separate wifi segment with its own unique SSID. If you do not pair your equipment with that new SSID you are not taking advantage of the extended range. Re-pairing all of my flood lights to the new wifi segment was the most time consuming part of the installation. It's only been a few days now but so far I am very pleased with this purchase.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "This product just doesn't work! Try a different brand!", "text": "I purchased this in hopes of extending the range of my router and I had done a lot of research and this one was on quite a few top lists of extenders.  I went through the setup steps in the manual both using WPS and via a web browser.  2 different purchases! Save yourself the trouble, especially if you are not computer savvy.<br /><br />1st attempt with extender #1:  This is through the WPS route.  I got it connected but I kept getting a \"Connected without Internet\" warning every so often.  After going to the Netgear website, I found that the solution was to update the firmware.  I attempted to do so, but somehow during the update it got stuck or corrupted and the power light just blinked red not stop.  I sat on the phone for over an hour with support (and that was after half an hour on hold), which I could barely understand the technician, and being told to do a factory reset over and over again.  (I tried this prior to calling them.)<br /><br />They then wanted me to change my computer settings to give myself a static IP and other setting changes. I was not about to do that because  I am not super knowledgeable in those settings and didn't want to mess with my personal computer.  I had also read in the help section that sometimes they want to remote into my computer.  Absolutely not! I just told them that I was on a work computer and did not have access to change those settings. After an hour, they told me that they would send me an email for instructions on how to send it back to Netgear and they would send me a replacement.  A week later, I still did not get the email and I called them back.  Another half-hour on the phone just to be told that I have to return it to Amazon since that is where I purchased it.<br /><br />2nd attempt with extender #2:  I got the replacement and went to set this up.  Did it via web browser this time only to have it not work part way through the set-up procedures.  I was following the directions, but when I got to the part where you connect to the new extender wifi, it stopped working. I could not navigate on the setup website any farther from here and just got a \"You are not connected to your extender's WiFi network\" even though my computer said I was. Stuck. I then did a factory reset and started the setup through WPS.  Again, I got it connected, but \"Connected without internet.\"  I called support again as I was not about to try to do a firmware update and have it freeze again on me.  After 34 min on hold, someone finally came on the line to help. Again, it was very hard for me to understand him.  He went through the setup with me again and it seems to be working for now.  If I have any further issues, I will update this review.<br /><br />Please note that you have to register your device before you can get help.  I accidentally typed in 2020 for the year on my replacement device and cannot change the date so I will not be able to get further help on that one.  I had to submit a ticket for the 1st device to get help.  The guy on the phone had no idea what I was talking about when I asked to have the purchase date updated.<br /><br />If this product stops working like the first one, I will return it again and buy a different brand.", "images": [], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AHPMCU3MVA3QCPELNHZ44EQI5TZA", "timestamp": 1623263177024, "helpful_vote": 23, "verified_purchase": true}

Any movies I tried to stream would take a very long time to load (if they loaded at all) and then would keep stopping or rebooting every few minutes. I had asked several technicians from major computer or network companies to help, but they were not able to improve the streaming. Then an independent technician doing some other work at my house suggested the Netgear AC 1200 Range Extender (EX6120). I ordered one, and after hooking it up and placing it between my router and TV, the movies all stream beautifully. No rebooting, no delays, no freezing up. It solved my problem immediately. (I had a bit of trouble figuring out how to connect the Netgear Range Extender the first time, but after a brief on-line chat with a Netgear technician, he walked me through the process easily). The Netgear Extender is small, unobtrusive and requires no wires or cables. It's great and I am extremely satisfied with it.

Even right next to the router, it was barely pulling 70 mbps (I have 400 mbps internet from spectrum) the same network without the extender gets in the 300/400\u2019s in the same place for perspective. However due to the thickness of my walls and distance, my bedroom Wi-Fi suffers dramatically with only delivering 40/50 mbps. This device boosted the 40/50 I was getting into 70/80. So, does it work? Yes. Does it work anywhere near what they advertise it as? No. If you don\u2019t have a super fast network, this might be ideal for you. I didn\u2019t expect to have the full 300/400 carry but to not even hit 1/4th the speed even when 2 ft away from the router was disappointing. Install was fairly easy but I ran into some issues with it only wanting to split the 2 G network into a 2 and a 5 instead of duplicating the 2 and 5 G networks my router already has. I had to manually go in via device IP and set the network preferences manually but it was very doable. The range extender web address they give you is garbage (at least it was for me) and wasted most of my time I spent setting the thing up. BUT just log into your router and pull the IP and punch that into a browser and you\u2019ll be golden. For the price, I guess it\u2019s acceptable.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Great, for desperate connections", "text": "Overall Positives: Okay, I'm not going to lie, this is great for something like a basement connection, or third floor where there's NO connection or basically unusable connection. I'm using this in our guest room as we have a media console in there and its network connection to our normal router was painfully slow. Unable to even watch Netflix. This extender honestly works great for that.<br /><br />Setup: Super easy, but I expected nothing else from a WPS setup. Any device that is WPS should be easy to configure. I haven't been able to get the network configuration page to work, even following the directions. The page says I'm not connected to the extender, but I am, and I have an outward-facing connection, so I'm not sure what that's about.<br /><br />Reliability: Had some issues reconnecting once when we restarted our primary router. Simply unplugging and restarting this extender resolved the issue, but it's still an issue, it should be able to handle that. Its range is honestly ridiculous. I have a connection to the darn thing from 2 floors above it (with it in the basement during my testing, my desktop picked up its connection with full bars.)<br /><br />Speed: This is why I'm writing this review... Everything else has been great, but don't fall for the false advertising on the speeds. We have a ridiculously fast network in our house over 500 mb/s down, which is ridiculous for our area. I only get 50 mb/s down on a good day with this extender. Remember, for a desperate, fast connection, this is amazing. Some people don't even have networks that fast, but they claim 1200 mb/s transfer, and it's nowhere near, and yes, my system and network are capable of testing that. I thought perhaps it was a connection or range issue, so I tested this in three different areas of my house, dramatically different areas. This included different floors, at different ranges and connection quality. It's consistent in it's speed, so that's good, maybe?<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent purchase if you need something small and simple to tuck away in a corner, but if you need something to replace or extend your current network speeds, and want more than 10% of your home network, might want to look elsewhere.", "images": [], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AFTQR6SW77EOMM63GETVHNXFEKBQ", "timestamp": 1643602364910, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

I had to return it.<br /><br />Even though Netgear had a paucity of negative reviews from Mac users, and their video actually featured Apple products, I just couldn't get the Netgear Range Extender to work, regardless of how many times I tried: it never connected to my Airport Express router and always defaulted to being a wi-fi access point instead of a wi-fi extender--useless to me. When I did get it to work, my download speed was under 1.00 Mbps. (That's not a typo.) Maybe that's idiosyncratic, but the on-line setup for Mac users was also not good: about halfway through the setup process, I was taken back to the first page to start again, and I took multiple attempts inputting the same information before I was allowed to complete the setup\u2014which, as it turned out, was completely to no avail anyway. After hours of trying, I gave up and re-boxed it. At least returning it for a refund was trouble-free.<br /><br />This past year, Apple officially announced it will discontinue development of Airport wi-fi products, so I'll eventually need to buy a third-party router anyway. At that point, I may purchase a compatible range extender as well. For now, I encourage other Airport Express users either to wait till they need a new router, or to bite the bullet and just get a second Airport Express to extend their network.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Great Low Cost Wifi Extender - UPDATED", "text": "UPDATE:  Adding these and trying to set up as a mesh did not work so well.  Having two set up seemed to cause interference also, they aren't made to create a mesh network.  Might have worked better with different network IDs, but then you're just constantly changing networks manually to get a signal.  Unfortunately, they don't keep connection with the main router through walls or floors well, so the router drops quite often.  I get the feeling these would only work well with line of site, but that kind of defeats the purpose.  For a cheap extender, it might work well in an apartment or small house, but not anything larger.  I just ordered a Netgear Orbi RBK50 unit, should do what I need.<br /><br />I picked up two of these for my house (3 stories) and use with a Netgear N600 dual band router.  Works pretty good, although in all honesty I only bought it for my video doorbell.  My router is on the 3rd floor in a cabinet (obvious problem, I know) and the doorbell is on the 1st floor (duh - most of the time).  I hadn't bought one of these before the doorbell, I had thought about it to get better WiFi outside, but that kind of defeats the purpose of being outside.<br /><br />Setup is a breeze, just plug in to the wall, go to mywifiext.net or use the Netgear app (I just used the web).  I set up the first on on my laptop, second on an iPad.  Pretty sure it can be done on a cell phone too, maybe I'll try that when I reconfigure the second unit I have.<br /><br />Once you're logged to to the Netgear site, setup is very straightforward.  Most will add as an extender, it will search for available networks, pick your WiFi and move on.  I named the extender networks the EXACT same as the main router (basic mesh network) so devices shouldn't be stuck on one extender or router, it should pick up the strongest signal while you move around the house.  So far it has worked well, although I bet devices which are advertised as mesh networks would work much better, but are more expensive.<br /><br />Again, I primarily bought this for my new video doorbell (SimpliSafe) because the doorbell doesn't have a very strong antenna and signal.  I had to add the extender for it to work properly.  I also recently added smart dimmer switches and sprinkler system controller, so I guess it helps those also.<br /><br />I did a speed check and it wasn't great, but neither was the receive/transmit signal from the router.  Bottom line, this device should give you a great network around the house, but likely won't work well if you have multiple users pulling lots of data at once.<br /><br />Would definitely purchase again if needed.", "images": [], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AE6RMGJ44X5LVB5DJN757GPVFMPA", "timestamp": 1583171968239, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

Instead, in \"extender\" you will configure another SSID and password so that if you find yourself getting a weak signal from your main Access Point you can switch to the extender.  I have been designing computer networks for 2 decades and it should not take me more than 25 minutes to get a home consumer repeater up and running.  It took almost 2 hours of messing with this device to get it usable only to find out the there is a significant delay when my devices (laptop, home attendant, etc) use the extender.  It may not sound like much but there is a consistent 1-3ms delay reponse time from the extender when doing something as simple as going to a website.

My router is a Symantec Core unit and it does not have a WPS button.  Therefore I had to access the device on line. I bought it to use as a Access Point but I was never able to set it up as one because the website that is needed to set up the Access Point is not available when the Access Point is being set up which is crazy and very frustrating.  So I finally gave up and set it up as an extender.  I was able to do this using my phone.  I was never able to do so using my computer.<br /><br />As an extender this device is worthless.  First the signal doesn't carry very far.  But far worse, the speed is chopped to nearly zero.  When I first set it up it seemed extremely slow so I decided to check it.  I brought it into my office where I have several computers set up, and in close proximity to the router.  I  have machines that are Ethernet connected and wireless connected.  Using the Ookla speed test, I checked my wired computers, my wireless computer and the wireless computer going through the extender.  I got speeds in the range of 110-120 Mbps down and 11-15 Mbps up with the Ethernet connected machine.  I got speeds in the 30-35 Mbps down and 8-10 Mbps up with the wireless machine.  Going through the extender, I only got a reading of about 1 Mbps down and nothing up.  I tried testing several times using different hubs and the results were similar.<br /><br />I learned several things doing these tests.  First, this extender is worthless, both as an access point (which I couldn't make it be) or as an extender as the throughput was terrible.

Setting this up was pretty simple using the WPS buttons on the extender and my router, which by the way is also a Netgear product. In the same room as the router the extender showed a strong connection to my router (green router light) so I know it is recognizing my router and connecting to it. I even tested a connection to a device (Roku) and it worked fine. Here's where things went south. When I moved it to the furthest wall in our home from the router which is only about 20 feet away with very few obstructions along the way, the extender starts off with a green router light indicating it has a strong connection. My bubble was bursted quickly as within a few minutes the light went amber then red indicating a poor signal. My cell phone when put in the same exact spot receives a very strong signal when connected to my wifi. So why not the extender?  I tried moving it closer to the router only to get the same results. Ultimately I had to put it within 5 feet of my router to get the router light to stay green. Anything beyond that seemed to result in a poor connection. I tried moving my router to a more open area in hopes that would help. Results were the same. I spent a lot of time troubleshooting in vain ending up with the same results (and a lot of frustration). I really thought this would work great especially given my router is the same brand. But only being able to place it 5 feet from my router to get a good connection renders this pretty useless to me.

I was able to extend our router signal to the opposite side of our house with a strong signal (our Fire TV Stick always responds with a \"Very Strong\" wireless signal).  Our wifi Blink Outside Cameras at the opposite of the side of the house also work great. Note: the Extender is picking up signal thru 3 walls.<br /><br />I did have an issue with initial setup -- the app to perform setup (mywifiext.net) could not be found when setting up with my desktop (Windows 10, Chrome, Edge or Firefox). I tried clearing cache several times and never got it working with any of these browsers.<br /><br />So I tried setting up with my iPhone and it worked great.  I did a factory reset on the Netgear Extender, turned on Wifi on my iPhone and \"Bam\" their was the Extender App ready for setup!<br /><br />Very happy with the product and will purchase another soon for another part of our house.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Purchased an N300 in November 2019 and read the instructions.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Works fine as extender but there are a few gotchas . . .", "text": "As an extender it does a good enough job.  It was very easy to set up using the router's WPS.  I estimate it delivers a usable signal for ~100 ft, but of course that is very dependent on its locn vis-a-vis the router, the antenna positioning on both devices, and the locns of your client devices.<br /><br />But there are several potential issues to be aware of that aren't mentioned in the mktg info or manual.  The first one is brought up in the Q&A section above, which IMO you should read before buying:  The extender will create a new SSID so any device using the extended network will need to use this SSID.  That may be fine if your device(s) is in a fixed locn, but if it's a mobile device you should check whether your device will automatically hand-off from one SSID to another, will at start-up look for the strongest wifi signal (so it may choose the router or the extender signal, depending on where you are), and just whether or not you want your mobile device to use more than one SSID (e.g., my iPhone 6S is strong enough to use the router's signal throughout the house, so I configured it to use that SSID only).<br /><br />Second, if you are using more advanced techniques with your router, be aware that the router will actually create two clients as the extender, not just one. You'll see in your logs that the extender's mac address is used for the initial hand-shake and authorization, but it is not assigned an IP address.  There will be a second virtual (pseudo) mac address too which will then be authorized at the same time and it will be assigned an IP by the router's DHCP server.  So 1 extender client using 2 mac's, but only 1 IP.  Furthermore, any device connected to the extender will not use its native hardware mac address, but again a pseudo mac address, although it will obtain its IP from the router DHCP server as normal.  So if you are e.g. using mac filtering or IP address assignment by mac address, you need to use the pseudo mac addresses for the extender's clients.  If your device uses both the router and extender SSID's, you'll need both native and pseudo mac addresses in your router tables and provision in your IP address pool for 2 addresses, 1 for each mac address.<br /><br />Third, and while this issue is admittedly obscure, it's still a possibility:  The extender's signal can interfere with other devices.  I have a Roku3 with a remote that I is spec'd to use &#34;WiFi Direct&#34; technology rather than IR or Bluetooth.  I wanted the extender to service the Roku, my Samsung smart tv, and my Chromecast.  But while I can use it for the Chromecast and tv (caveat, see next issue below), not the Roku.  Fortunately, the Roku has a strong wifi transceiver so it can use the router's signal instead (another option might be to use a smartphone app to control the Roku which might permit putting it on the extender, but haven't tested that yet - again, see below).<br /><br />Finally, note that some smart apps indicate that the mobile device using the app must be on the same network as the device being controlled.  So if you have a device you are controlling from your smart phone, it's definitely possible that the phone must be on the same SSID as that device.  All three of my devices may work off the extender using a smart phone app rather than the provided remote, but it is highly likely that to do so will require putting the phone on the extender's SSID.<br /><br />So the bottom line is, this extender works very well as long as your location, devices, network configuration, and router all cooperate with what you want to do.  If  the configuration and usage characteristics such as described above are not an issue, it will probably serve you well.", "images": [], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AGLO2SBOREWEAAPS6HNS5VJYQZZQ", "timestamp": 1453329393000, "helpful_vote": 15, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Just what I was MISSING!!!!", "text": "Living in Manhattan you get use to things not always working right and as I didn't need wi-fi for work it's speed was never a real issue because as a restaurant manager I never would bring my work home. Then 5 years ago I lost half my right foot, then the following year after that I lost my left leg below the knee...now I'm home all the time and watch more TV than ever and I'm online more than ever, and trying to keep bills inline (cable in Manhattan is OUTRAGEOUS...triple play $170.. and I only have 1 box). I started looking into ways to save money and last year a friend gave me an APPLE TV and hooked it up for me and everything but my biggest problem was buffering....it made me not want to watch the damn thing (I had netflix on my PS3 and didn't use it for the same reason). I didn't want to move my home computer and equipment from my office where I have everything because I didn't want to over crowd and already overcrowded living-room. I had looked at getting a Range Extender for quite sometime but kept putting it off and thought it might be I just needed a new Router so I replaced that first and it helped but not enough, then someone told me I really needed to get a range extender SO I did a lot of research and decided on Netgear (which had been recommended by a few friends) this helped in SO many ways. One thing I didn't realize was that between all the wired and wireless equipment and overlapping signals and neighbor's wi-fi signals and cable company's hot-spot signals it was slowing me down (it's what happens when you live with 8 million other people). SO after following the instructions (I use to be Tech savvy then I got lazy in the early 2000's and having lots of friends in their 20's I just had people do it for me) Now I'm on a I need to learn this stuff and at 51 it's so easy after you get the hang of it.This was SO easy to set up just take your time and read the manual and it only took me about 10 minutes, I took my time and by the end of the night I had hooked everything up and changed all my passwords (make sure you write everything down and put in a safe place the last thing you want to do is forget these passwords) The first thing I noticed was how fast and responsive my tablet had become then I noticed that my APPLE TV and PS3 had become faster and guess what...NO BUFFERING, it has been nice watching shows during prime time and not have to wait for a signal, and as great as this is I do plan on getting another extender for even faster service, I like the fact that I'll be able to plug my Apple TV right into the extender and having that wired connection is always better {to me} and the extender is not in a spot where I want to run a cable (I'm also getting a new cable modem to save more money on my cable bill {$96.00}...I now love my range extender  and wish I had gotten one a couple of years ago I'm sure I would have saved several hundred dollars by now. I now plan on getting rid of my triple play and just going with Super hi speed internet...between Tivo, Range Extenders, Netflix, Hulu, a digital phone service and a HD antenna I could be able to save $800-$900 dollars a year. I love my range extender so much I think I may give a few as gifts this year...great job Netgear!...THANKS!!!", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kCb96f+IL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kCb96f+IL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71kCb96f+IL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AEEAZ5KSDWGAG67X4BCWLJKDY6VQ", "timestamp": 1469186896000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great way to give your business/home emergency backup internet services", "text": "I typically recommend these units to people who have equipment with Ethernet jacks but without WiFi.  What you can do is use this unit to link your wired equipment into your wireless network.  To do this you simply configure this unit to connect to your wireless network then use a network cable (Ethernet cable) to connect your equipment to this unit.  Instant network access for whatever you want.  Just be aware the bandwidth isn't going to be equal to cable connectivity.<br /><br />Now a use which isn't widely known is the ability to use this for backup internet connectivity in some cases.  NOTE I SAID SOME CASES.  What you'll need is a router with a WAN port that normally connects to a modem, or other device, which provides internet access.  If you have this - a router with a WAN port - then you can do the following to provide emergency internet backup for your entire network:<br /><br />1) Configure your cell phone to be a mobile hotspot.<br />2) Configure this unit to connect to your cell phone's mobile hotspot via WiFi.<br />3) Plug an Ethernet cable into this unit.<br />4) Plug the other end of the Ethernet cable into your router's WAN port.  No not LAN port - WAN port.<br />5) If your router's WAN port is configured to obtain IP address for anything other than DHCP you may need to tweak some settings.  Normally connected to a hotspot you want the WAN port setup to be 'obtain IP from DHCP'.<br /><br />Instantly you should have internet access for your entire network.  Note however you will also instantly be using whatever data plan you have on your cell phone.  Data usage connected this way can be staggering - so if you don't have an unlimited plan you need to be aware it could be expensive.  But if all you're doing is validating credit card transactions this may be worth it.  Your connections should be changed back when your service has been restored.  Note:  You could use something like a Linksys LRT224 which would automatically switch back.  I use a Linksys LRT214 and can confirm this setup works perfectly - but this requires manually switching cables back and forth.", "images": [], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AFJUXUKA7KP644XQZ5ZQHZYEJUSQ", "timestamp": 1596313167966, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Netgear support is the worst.  Avoid their garbage products at all costs.", "text": "I am done with Netgear.  This thing just doesn't work unless you have a few specific routers.  The configuration is garbage.  If you are running a commercial access point or open source firmware, good luck.  It will not work.  Netgear will refuse to help.  You will waste at least two hours of your time with their support who will just go through the guided setup again with you (which will never work).  Eventually you can get the wireless portion to work with some obscure dynamic DNS revisions to the router (you will have to google this - Netgear support has no clue), but the ethernet port will never work.  Unfortunately the ethernet port is the main reason I wanted this.<br /><br />When you update to the latest firmware as of today (1/13/18) it will randomly decide if it wants to allow devices to access it or not when it is power cycled.  This means that every time your power goes out, you have a pretty good chance that you will be reseting this thing.  This didn't happen until I updated to the latest firmware.  Considering it takes about five full minutes to restart, you can imagine how much time you will be wasting, wondering if the device is going to allow devices to connect.<br /><br />I can't express the disgust with Netgear's support.  If you go to their website and click that you want to call for support for this device it will take you to an email form.  They don't even want to waste their time chatting about the issues.  You can google the phone number and after being harassed by the automated responder for about 10 minutes you will be connected to a completely disinterested employee at Netgear.  Their main goal is to get you off the phone as soon as possible.  Even a customer hang up is considered a successful support call for Netgear.  After owning the device for more than 90 days, this wonderful support feature will cost you....  $65 a year!!!! I am not joking.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "I will not buy from this company again--- update", "text": "I will not buy items from this company again. I bought this Wi-Fi extender, after another Netgear Wi-Fi extender was not providing the coverage that I needed for my home. I called several times since installing this extender to get help with placement because I was not getting adequate coverage from my router to my bedroom. We worked with placement, reconfigured it, and reinstalled it. I still only get spotty coverage in my bedroom. The last time I called them was last week and somebody assisted me. I called today and said I was still having problems. I indicated that I did have a second Netgear Wi-Fi extender and asked whether they could both be installed together on my network. After 15 minutes of giving them serial numbers, phone numbers, emails, the representative (Haritha #1713) indicated that she could indeed reconfigure my router so that I could install both Netgear products on my network and indicated that it would take care of the coverage problem. I thanked her and said let's go ahead and do this. I indicated that I wished somebody else would have suggested that earlier on. She then informed me that she would take care of the problem, but at the end of the call, since I was out of warranty that I would be required to purchase an additional technical support package for not only my Netgear products, but all electronics in my home. She indicated that the cheapest they offer is a three month package for $89. I said that in no way do I want them to take care of anything other than the Netgear products. I indicated that I purchased this product and it has never worked correctly. I indicated that I had called several times within the three month warranty. And nobody had indicated that there were other options that we could consider. I indicated that $89 was as much as I paid for both of their products. I indicated that they manufacture the products, have training and expertise in how to install them and get them working correctly, and that I should not have to pay more than the cost of these products to have this done. I spoke with her supervisor Naresh (1484) who indicated that he was not willing to help me set their product up correctly unless I paid an additional $89. I indicated that I should not be asked to pay for their products and then pay double that to have it set up correctly. I said I would go ahead and write a review on Amazon to warn other people that this is how their company treats their customers. I indicated that I would not purchase their products again. I also plan to write the CEO of Netgear to complain about this practice. I would like others to be aware. I do not write negative reviews often at all.<br />Update--I called corporate-after 20 minutes a representative in charge of technical support indicated that they would give me a one time okay to get this issue addressed. She indicated that she put this in my records and gave me a number to call and a case number. I just spent 30 minutes on the phone with a representative you said he would be happy to do this, indicated that he had my information in front of him, but he had to consult with a senior advisor. He indicated that the problem would get addressed and solved. He came back on the phone and indicated that he could not do this. He indicated that there was nothing in my records from corporate that said I could have a one time technical support call. I indicated I had just spoken with corporate several hours ago. He said there was nothing in the file. He tried to sell me the $89 one time contract. Why are we letting this company get away with this? So many times I have written reviews that highlight an excellent product, excellent customer service, and a delightful experience-this is not an example of that despite my best efforts to offer a different ending to this story.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Working well so far, but no better than an N300 (if you can't set yours up, connect to it via Ethernet during the setup)", "text": "This is my second attempt at getting this extender from Amazon Warehouse Deals and it works pretty well. I set it up today.<br /><br />The first one arrived yesterday from AWD, but someone had switch the labels....they put a less expensive model (N300/EX2700) back in the box with the labels of an AC1200/EX6120...not cool.<br /><br />It's back in the box & being returned, but I went ahead and tried again and got the real-deal today.<br /><br />Anyway, as soon as the correct EX6120 arrived I set it up.<br />I always have to connect to new (Netgear) range extenders via Ethernet cable for the initial setup, but after that it's usually fine. I just move it to the room I need to be in and we're good to go.<br /><br />If you're not able to get your extender working by using only WiFi (via WPS) then you have to temporarily disconnect from your modem/router and connect directly to the Netgear extender in the same room as your main PC and then open your browser to www.mywifiext.net in order to set it up.<br /><br />If you only use one modem/router, disconnect from it and manually connect your PC to the extender in the same room (only during setup... after it's set up, then you can move it to where you need to).<br /><br />If you connect to a router, that then connects to a modem like I do, disconnect from the modem and connect via Ethernet to the extender to set it up using your browser at mywifiext.net.<br /><br />Once the setup screen opens up and you're able to name your extender, your regular router will add the extender to its &#34;client list&#34; and assign its own IP address, which you can use in the future to access the router via your internet browser using 192.168.X.X or use www.mywifiext.net<br /><br />NOTE: be sure to turn off the SSID Broadcasting after the set up is complete...it's better security...and in the extender's IP page, after it's been installed, when you turn off the SSID Broadcast you'll see a message that the extender won't work without SSID Broadcasting...NOT TRUE....it works fine. I don't broadcast our SSID for any routers or extenders...it's better security...your neighbors & passer by's cannot see your router's name.<br /><br />Any device that needs to connect to your router or extender can easily do so, you just manually setup the connection the first time by extender (or router) name & passkey. Thereafter, it will connect automatically.<br /><br />This range extender will be replacing an older, slower Netgear extender that is always losing the connection.<br /><br />So far, this EX6120 is working fine, but, like other reviewers, I had to turn off the 5G to get the 2G signal to work. And, even though this EX6120 has longer antennae (than the N300), the range isn't any better than that of the N300.<br /><br />Given the above, there's really no reason to spend the extra money on the EX6120. I'm basically using it as an N300.<br /><br />So, for the money, I recommend sticking with the N300. I got my EX6120 from Amazon Warehouse Deals so I didn't pay the regular retail price. I paid about the same as the N300 Amazon retail price. Had I known the limitations of this EX6120, I would have gotten an N300 (...and not one disguised as an EX6120....LOL).", "images": [], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AGNCE25FHVO4NEW776VMPTSSFRBA", "timestamp": 1524457366266, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Lagging and dropped signal actually got worse!", "text": "This booster had some pretty good reviews but from now on, before I buy I'm going to the product website and finding out how new or old the product I'm considering buying really is because this one is obviously going obsolete as Netgear doesn't even have it listed on its main product page although I was able to download the manual for it from deep within the website itself.<br />(NOTE: Always download a manual the moment you buy, you're on the website registering so take that extra moment to grab a download of your manual too. Create a file and dump every single one you get in to it, then ignore it until you can't find your hardprint manual and you're desperate for directions.  After 5-10yrs or even 1-2 yrs there's hardly a company that still has downloadable manuals.<br /><br />I bought this wifi boost to increase connectivity to a tablet in the room at the back of the place that was always glitching and losing bar strength.<br />1st install attempt I did myself and it was simple and smooth according to directions and programmed in the same room as my desktop and router, then installed it in a room between router and a tablet-use room. All well for about 2 days then the tablet in the back room started lagging and dropping off and also my desktop in the router room started losing connectivity, which had never happened before in 5yrs. Got so bad, I uninstalled it.<br />2nd attempt, I programmed an alternate way in the manual but wasn't comfortable with how it seemed to end the programming before I got to the end of the instructions but it had good bar strength. This time I installed it directly in the room the tablet was being used in but ended up uninstalling it for the same reason as install #1 - lagging and dropped signal.<br />3rd attempt 3/4/21 and this time I called Netgear. My obsolescence suspicions were pretty much confirmed when they had to track down a tech to help me with this specific booster.<br />That's a really bad sign, anytime about anything!<br />Theo the Tech was awesome though. It must have taken at least 30min to install it by web browser setup but by the time he was done I had a separate network connection for my booster in both 2G and 5G and even unique<br />passwords on both new accounts.  It seemed all problems were solved but...within 2hrs both our devices were having the same issues again; I gave up for the day and slept on it, only to remember<br /> that I had not moved the booster back to the in-between room or even the tablet-use room so in to the tablet room it went, from one wall plug to another, hoping to find one that would hook up with the router and after trying 2 plugs and even seeing the router light turn red when only green and amber are ever mentioned in the manual - it finally stayed green on the router light.<br />I wish I could just get my money back at this point.", "images": [], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AHORDNMHYEIZEUCTLRLQJQW7KZIA", "timestamp": 1615022314246, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Junk. Don't buy", "text": "Well, I've spent about 4 hours on Christmas day trying to connect this extender to my router. I would like to mention that this is an Amazon \"used-returned\" product and now I know why. I will return it myself. I would like to mention that installation isn't as simple as they make it sound in the instructions. The extender would not connect to my AT&T Uverse router via WPS button at all. Yes, I was in the same room with the router 5 feet away from it. Finally I completed the connection via the LAN cable. Hook the router to the Netgear extender via LAN cable. I used the Netgear genie and it took about 10-15 min. The repeater is dual band. It has 2.4 and 5Ghz. I added both bands and did the passwords for both. Most modern devices will connect via 5GHz which is way faster. After setting it up with LAN cable ( if you don't have one you're in trouble) I moved the repeater about 20 feet away from router in a different room. Extender still has a good connection to the router. So far so good. The problem is, the device you have, as you move away from the main router, won't automatically connect to the WiFi extender as you get closer to it. You have to do it manually, which of course defeats the purpose. When doing it manually, 3 feet away from extender, sometimes it connects, sometimes it doesn't. When it doesn't, it stays stuck on \"obtaing IP\". If it does connect, it only works if you're about 5-10 feet away in that room..if you move about 20 feet away, no more connection and unfortunately device won't connect to regular router, I have to do it manually. My advice to anyone wanting an extender? Get the one recommended by your internet provider. If you do, it is made to pair up easily with the provider's router. ATT has one they sell, but I took the cheap way out.( cheap only because my wifi extender was used, otherwise, not cheap). This NETGEAR unit is way too finicky and not powerful enough. Device connected to it has to be in the same room with it and let's hope it isn't a very big room. Save yourself some time and headaches. Get the extender recommend by your internet provider and let them install it and set it up if possible. The reason they recommend a certain extender is because after trial and error, they realized which one works and connects best with their routers.<br />Today, December 26th I've spent 45 minutes on the phone with Netgear support. Basically we reset and reinstalled. Netgear support came to the conclusion that unit is broken and advised to send back to Amazon.

Fortunately, that is basically my bedroom, so I picked an empty outlet, plugged it in, connected to it as I would any other internet connection, and then went out to the back of the yard (the cottage) and YESSSSS, we have INTERNET! It didn't connect to the &#34;5G&#34; option (whatever that is) but it connected to the 2G option with strong signal. I tested Netflix, and had no trouble being able to get a clear video.

Needless to say, although my 2G had decent range, the range on my 5G suffered tremendously.<br /><br />(Basically, if my router was out of site, I had no real access to 5G.)<br /><br />In my bedroom, not only was 5G inaccessible, but the slower 2G was unacceptable (and unstable).<br /><br />So... I purchased this, followed the WPS instructions 2x (twice), as per instructions (for those operating a dual band router).<br /><br />The instructions are simple:<br /><br />1st, plug in and power on the extender near the router (and give it a minute to 'warm up').<br /><br />2nd, press the WPS button on the extender (it will blink repeatedly).<br /><br />3rd, press (and in my case, hold) the WPS button on the router (which blinked as well, on the router).<br /><br />4th, wait for the WPS LED on the extender to turn solid green (which indicates a connection (1st, to the 2G).<br /><br />***Repeating steps 2-4 will link a second connection to 5G (if you have a dual-band router).<br /><br />5th, unplug the extender, and place/plug it midway between the router and the device(s) which will access it (which in my case was near the entrance of my bedroom).<br /><br />Lastly... Search for the extender's SSID --- ending in '_EXT'.<br /><br />Since I wanted to extend and obtain access to 5G, I searched for the '...5G_EXT', typed in the same password used to access my roter's wi-fi, and VIOLA! I now have access to 5G in my bedroom, all bars MAXED!<br /><br />Since my devices aren't accessing the 5G from the router directly, there is some (theoretical) loss in speed (which I do not notice).<br /><br />One thing for sure, however, is the internet speed in my bedroom is now MUCH faster (and more reliable) since I can now tap into the 5G speeds which I couldn't access before the extender.<br /><br />Thus, &#34;Mission Accomplished!&#34;<br /><br />The directions are so simple, I think a lot of people over-complicate it. I almost did.<br /><br />They said to repeat the steps to link a second connection to 5G; that's what I did.<br /><br />Maybe someday I'll try to configure it for other security measures I've read other reviewers mentioned...<br /><br />But for now...

My range is not any better than it was before I added the extender. I purchased this after reading reviews that bragged about how much area they gained with this extender. One review stated that they placed this extender 100 feet away from the router, in an exterior building, and that they had excellent reception. Netgear customer service told me that the extender must be within 20 feet of the router in order for it to work.

First of all, I have  300 mbps  internet and even when getting a very strong signal (I even tested it right next to the main router), the best this has managed to pull off was 150 mbps on the 5ghz band.  In addition, the 5ghz band never worked right.  When you connected to the 5ghz network, it would work fine for about 30 minutes, then, all of a sudden I would get messages from my web browser saying could not locate website ip address or something to that effect.  Once this happened, the only way to fix it was to disconnect the from Wi-Fi network and reconnect.  This made the 5ghz band completely unusable for online gaming or video calls where it's very important that you have a solid connection.  I've never had this problem on my main router.  You may be asking why don't I use the 2.4 ghz band. Well, with that I get around 30 to 60 mbps.  That's a 10x decrease at worst!!!!  I've spent hours playing around with its crappy configuration settings, changing dns settings, changing ip addresses etc. Granted, it was still better than no extender but still not an ideal experience.<br /><br />Recently, it started to randomly stop working requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in.  By \"stop working,\" I mean it just flat out didn't work or would deliver speeds of around 10kbps - 500 kbps!!! That's fine for 1999, but in 2021 it's completely and utterly useless.  Finally, 3-4 of days ago, power cycling it no longer worked and now it's pretty much trash.<br /><br />If everything I've just said went over your head, here's the summary: It never worked correctly, while it did extend the Wi-Fi, it made it extremely slow and now it just doesn't work any more.

Extends both WiFi bands at the same time (2.4 and 5Ghz), but reduces WiFi performance.<br />FastLane Technology - Offers maximum performance but limits connection to one band (2.4 or 5GHz).<br />Router-to-Extender in 5GHz only and Extender-to-Device in 2.4GHz only (Router must support 5GHz band).<br /><br />I of course took the middle option and I use the 5GHz band between AP and extender and 2.4GHz for devices.

He asked me to allow him to connect to my laptop so he can trouble shoot. Great! Don't really like that but I let him do it. Half the time I didn't see him do anything, the screen was not moving at all. Maybe he was reading up on what to do on his end. The tech kept doing the same rebooting process over and over again for an hour! I got frustrated with this nonsense and I told him to forget about this, I'm sending this product back. He goes on to tell me that this product has a lot of issues and recommends me another product, a little higher on the performance side from this extender which doesn't seem to give any issues, according to him. OK great! so why are you selling this product with known issues still?<br />Overall, horrible product, that only lasted 3 weeks. I have had no luck with Netgear products and the last one I had was a router that got disconnected from my modem every week which I finally gave up on about 3 years back. Replaced with an Asus router and problem solved. I hoped that Netgear has improved in their quality but they just don't work for me. In my opinion I think the whole issue is in its firm ware.

I plugged the device in, waited for the lights to stabilize and then looked for the new URL that showed up in my WiFi list of resources. I then connected my IPAD to that device and the online screen popped up that allowed me to configure the device.

Tech support did nothing more than use the same install directions that I followed myself with no good result (couldn't connect to the internet at 5G on the extender with their help which made their help quite useless).  Netgear then tries to force you to buy a one year extension to the warranty for the same price as the extender costs.  In sum, don't waste time and money on this extender.

Other extender I have (Netgear AC1900) were able to use the same wireless as the main router and did not need to use -ext to hook up to.  See the list of wireless networks to see what I mean.  That said, the speed into the house is over 800meg with ethernet cable to computer, speed from the Netgear AC1750 wireless router with Netgear AC1900 extender is over 200meg, but drops down to under 50meg with the Netgeat AC1200.  Still plenty fast enough to support all the devices I have hooked to this extender.  For the price, 50meg is adequate for I would guess 90% of the population.  For anyone with 100meg interne this extender should be fine since it can handle 50meg (see picture).  Should be able to run printers, Alexa, wireless speakers and probably TV with video streaming.  I'm not a gamer, so I defer to someone else to answer if 50meg is enough for gaming.  The only negative I can find is I couldn't hook it up to one network as I did with my Netgear AC1900, but had to set up an -ext to hook specific devices to individually.  Maybe the capability is there the same as it is for the Netgear AC1900, but I haven't figured it out yet.  I had to plug it upside down due to bottom plug style, but it works just fine upside down.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Second Guessing My Decision Making Now", "text": "Purchased this yesterday due to several online review sites listing this as one of 2019's top two wifi extenders for under $100. Got it same day delivery. LOVE AMAZON PRIME! Received it late in the day, so at about 11pm  started hooking this up as a repeater for my 3 Camera Arlo system. Old generic repeater suddenly stopped working after a power surge. So after messing around with this Netgear extender for an hour, never getting the 5G side to provide internet, I called Netgear tech support. Two hours on the phone trying to troubleshoot with tech support. We never did get the 5G side working. Was told I'd have to contact my Router Manufacturer and have them switch my router channel. WHAT?!!! So put the 5G thing on the back burner, and just rely on the 2.4G for the Arlo, so I'd at least have cameras running for the night. Hooked the Arlo Smart Hub up to the Ethernet Port, and low and behold, NO INTERNET to the Arlo hub. Called Netgear tech support back, another hour on the phone until we came to the conclusion that the Ethernet Port on this extender must be faulty, so I'd need to exchange it. To be honest, I think that was just the quickest way to get rid of me because the tech was at a loss. Mind you, this is all taking place between 11pm and 3am. That's how many hours I've been messing with this thing. Called Amazon, and being the awesome customer service they are, shipping me out a replacement this morning, which I should have later today. But NOW I start reading the Amazon customer reviews. Now I'm thinking maybe I should have just opted for a refund and purchased a second router. I guess we'll see how it goes, and if we get it all working as it should, and I'm not dropping connections ever other day, like a lot of others are complaining about, then I'll keep it. But if it so much as even looks at my funny within the 30 day window, it's going back, and will look into just purchasing a good second router to use as a repeater.", "images": [], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AGYHYIAM374JOBSS2S5TN4P2VPIA", "timestamp": 1569669698167, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

When you enter the address as instructed, you see that you can only set up certain Netgear models using the browser, and this wasn't one of them. How handy - NOT. If you try to connect using your computer's wireless find-and-join program, it might ask for a Network Security Key, also not provided in the instructions or on the unit itself.<br /><br />UPDATE: I eventually got it to work, but not by following the instructions in the skimpy manual. I did a web search and found alternate instructions (involving an IP address to be used for the extender). I still have problems with connectivity, where it will say \"connected but no internet connection\" for a long time then all of a sudden come on. Once it does finally connect to the internet, it seems to stay reliably connected with multiple devices. You may be using the factory reset more than once, as well.<br /><br />UPDATE #2: Ended up returning it after struggling for hours with a \"no Internet connection\" message on every device, even after unplugging it and then plugging it back in.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "WORKS GREAT - FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER", "text": "I purchased two of these for Arlo wireless base stations. One works great and was easy to install. The other one is being returned for replacement because 2.4 GHz is flaky, probably due to a loose antenna on the right side. A couple of important notes. First, during initial set up, place the unit very close to your main WiFi device (same room or closer). If not, you are begging for problems. I used a tablet to connect to the extenders, one at a time and unplugged the first extender immediately after configuration so it does not interfere with the second one being configured. Once the extender is set up, you lose Internet connectivity because it is now operating on your new SSID and its password. You need to reconnect your tablet (or other device) to the new SSID and password before proceeding with final set-up. This connection takes a few minutes with several automatic re-tries, but eventually connects. Because I am using two of these extenders on the same WiFi system, I add an A at the end of the SSID on one and a B at the end of the other (Ralph_EX6120_2G-extA & Ralph_EX6120_5G-extA and Ralph_EX6120-2G-extB & Ralph_EX6120-5G-extB). I turned off the 5G radio and disabled its SSID broadcast because I did not need 5G extended. Since I am only using them as an Ethernet connections to the Arlo Base stations, I might turn off 2G and turn on 5G so as not to have so many devises operating on 2.4G where the cameras operate, but 2.4G works great now with clear camera resolution.", "images": [], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AHVRVJD2G2KRUU6AIULQURRWVDGA", "timestamp": 1534864590993, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Worked but not as expected", "text": "The three stars are mostly from the tech support of Netgear. I ordered this product hoping to get a better signal in my upstairs loft. I have an Netgear ac1900 R700 router that works perfect. The signal is strong enough to reach the loft (router is in the basement) and I can stream on my appleTV and surf the net with no issues most of the time. 1st issue I encountered was that the extender would connect to the router but would not connect to the internet. I had to call customer support and after they determined that they needed to change a setting for my router they said they would change it for me for free if I purchased a 6 month warranty for my router. If I did not purchase the warranty then they would charge me $50. The tech kept telling me it was free, but only if I payed an additional $100+ dollars.  I have had the router for 3 years and it is great, I have never had an issue adding any device to this router until I tried adding the extender. The tech was really pushing for me to purchase additional warranties throughout the process. He finally did the adjustment for free after I told him it would just be better/cheaper if I returned the extender.  Now that it works it is a separate network from my original router and that was not what I wanted.  If you are looking for a wifi mesh solution then this is not the product you are looking for. I did return this and will purchase a wifi mesh system that will work with my existing router as an access point.", "images": [], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AGL5FFSOP7ZDZ5N5EBGKA3FOXPNA", "timestamp": 1544310559070, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

I tried the Netgear Nighthawk that was really too powerful for the internet speed I had and that I could not get to work.  I then purchased this AC1200 and it works beautifully. I am able to stream Amazon Prime video, Netflix and HBOGO to my bedroom with ease.  This is a winner for me.  Even though I have a lower speed 2.4gz internet with Uverse, this range extender works great to give me the power I need throughout my house...even through a tiled bathroom and several walls.  I also got a $10 coupon on this deal.  I am so glad I purchased this item.  As for installation, I do it on the computer rather than through the WPS button.  However, after you get the Netgear AC1200 to show up on your wifi, you have to give it time to connect further before clicking on continue.  I found it was not an instant thing.  As a matter of fact, I thought it wasn't working because it kept saying it had not connected.  I got side tracked with something and when I came back, it had connected!  My best advice is after you make sure it is on your network, don't give up and give it some time to connect.

Our modem is downstairs and my roommate living upstairs complained about connection problems. These problems included 1) Unable to stream, constant buffering  2) Unable to download files, files timed out. It is easy to setup, but the device we bought on Amazon completely destroyed our home network. It changed the name of our network, even though it's not supposed to do this, and the network had a password that differed from the one our network, which it also not supposed to do.Everyone in our house (7 people) were up in arms because they couldn't get online. I got really frustrated and tried a lot of passwords which included the ones on the back of our modem. Nothing worked. I ended up having to call our internet provider and they changed our network back to the way it was before. I was aghast. The next day while everyone was out of the house I tried again, but this time I restore the device back to factory settings. This time everything worked the way it was supposed to in the directions. The reason I give this one star is because the only thing that explains what happened is that someone owned this product before us. But they sold it as a new product. So basically, it is very possible you will get a used one, and if you do its going to knock down your network, unless you are smart enough to hit the reset button using a paper clip before you connect it to your network, but the directions don't ask or tell you to do this.

For the review, I set it up using WPS and via Ethernet cable.<br />I place the router not more than 50 feet and initially had issues with signal so I found a different spot - boom took care of it. The lights on the front are easy to see at all times and it gives you signal strength status. Antennas are maneuverable so you should be able to find a good signal. I didn't care that it didn't have a is port though some might. My usage didn't require it though my next purchase will. The Netgear_EXT Wi-Fi network on the extender is unprotected so understand that. You can use this as a access point as well. I loved analytics app because I could see every device connected to it. I hv android so I was in good shape.<br /><br />Now for the not so good. I had 8 devices hooked up to it - all 2.4g band and got poor throughput. Shuddering with excellent signals, freezes and to fix it I had to restart the device and those connected to it only for it to happen again. I measured only 21mbps thru-put And the specs say GbE gigabit. It doesn't use beam-forming or MU-MIMO technologies for solid connection for a lot of devices. I only had 8 and it had issues. I took it down to 4 and then 2 and I just can't take it anymore.<br /><br />I contacted them about this and their nightgown R7000P that drops so much it's hard to get lot of production done but they didn't answer not one of my emails even with the 90 day 24/7 tech help. But the community was a help but didn't fix anything. I just found that other buyers of the product had similar issues.<br /><br />As we spask I'm looking for a much better unit. I can't blame netgear for my oversight on the MIMO - but this extenders technology  is outdated.  So if you want to cheaply fill in a gap in single ok buy it. But if you need more then this is not the unit.<br />My biggest disappointment  was that they never responded so I didn't get the tech service they offered and i had issues with the router and still do.

After reading other reviews prior to ordering it, I did expect it to perform better than it does as far as its signal strength is concerned, but perhaps my expectations were too high. I placed it in a hallway outlet in about the middle of my home, about 30 ft. away from my wi-fi router, and the same distance from my TV, which I stream to. Before installing this, streaming would be interrupted to buffer whatever we were watching. Now after installation, this has not been a problem at all. We have also noticed increased signal strength in other wireless devices, but from what other reviews said, I really expected a much stronger signal. This may have to do with interference from structures within my home. Increased signal strength outside my home is better also.

I uneasily allowed him to connect to my computer where he pointed to a &#34;Network Access Protection&#34; issue and they could fix for just $150. I of course said no thanks and disconnected.

Well, likely OK, but to be safe I knew what to do, stopped the start, shutdown my router, started by loading files manually while inspecting. I had some issues and also knew how to fix protection they/unit installation messed. My son a software engineer/coder and I got on together remotely and fixed everything in just minutes - no $150.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Can't use both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz signal from router simultaneously", "text": "One thing to know about these sorts of extenders--they don't work seamlessly, you have to connect to a different SSID than your main router in order to use the extended range.  For instance, if you normally connect to a network named &#34;MyRouter&#34;, you won't be using the extended range unless you connect to a new network named something like &#34;MyRouterExtender&#34;, which is the network being broadcast by your new Netgear range extender.  I was hoping this thing would work as a signal repeater, but it does not.<br /><br />But that's not why I'm rating this device as two-stars.  The other thing to know is that this doesn't work as advertised--you can't extend both your 2.4Ghz and your 5Ghz signals simultaneously.  When I did that, I was only able to connect to my extender's 2.4Ghz network.  If I tried to connect to the extender's 5Ghz network, it wouldn't connect.  The workaround for this is to only extend either your 2.4Ghz network OR your 5Ghz network.  You can still have the extender broadcast a 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz signal, but they'll both be backhauled to your router over whichever network you chose to set up.<br /><br />I had to search the internet to find this answer, and it seems to be either a bug in the way it's implemented, or the device is advertised with features it doesn't actually have.<br /><br />So, buyer beware.", "images": [], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AFC2COTC4XBLXJ7BJJWWZZYXEDBA", "timestamp": 1503873469164, "helpful_vote": 118, "verified_purchase": true}

If it's closer to the router then your device may switch to when it doesn't need to again slowing your data transfer. Although these worked I experienced these issues as in the past with other ext's. Ended up buy more powerful router and locating it better in the home.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Nice little Wifi extender!", "text": "I purchased this unit to get internet to a detached garage that is about 100 feet away from the house. In simple terms, this works very well for my needs which includes everything except heavy duty streaming of movies. I followed the instructions using WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) on the extender and my router and was completed within a few minutes. I then took the extender to the remote location and plugged it in. Two minutes later, I was online using the extended WiFi (uses different SSID than the main router). When the unit was running a 5G link between the extender and the house, I was able to get 70Mbps download speeds on my phone and laptop. When running a more stable 2Ghz link to the house and 5G on the extended WiFi, I was able to get 40Mbps. In the house I have 300Mbps service that usually yields around 280-290 Mbps service. This is provided to show that you will always sacrifice some speed using an extender!<br /><br />More Detailed Setup: In my case, I did my best to get the source router as close as possible to the edge of the house so as to provide the best signal possible to the extender. I have it setup running a 2.4Ghz (locked down) link from the house to the extender and then a CAT5 cable from the extender into my office which is about 40 feet away. I am not using the extended wifi although I am using another Linksys Wifi router as an access point in the office. I currently have two laptops, a desktop, and a hardwired network printer running though the extender and it works great. Keep in mind that 2.4Ghz has much better range than 5ghz but the throughput is less. I regularly get 40-50Mbps throughput on all my devices. I have been using this about three weeks and it works great. I will post back later if anything negative happens.", "images": [], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AHHI7A6H72WELHLTET6G34TRMECQ", "timestamp": 1547244662998, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "This is not the same as WiFi mesh.", "text": "I knew going in to keep my expectations modest.  This device is being used to expand WiFi coverage in an apartment setting.  There was a \"dead\" corner in the far bedroom.  This device provides coverage in that dead corner.  It works as described, and does more or less what I expected.  Setup was pretty easy if you are technically inclined, but could be difficult if you are not.  If you don't know what's happening, or how WiFi works at some level, I would not recommend using this.<br /><br />I set it up to use Fast Lane.  This talks to the router on 2.4G, and provides WiFi locally on a new 5G network.  This setup is more efficient because a packet is only in the air once on each frequency, as opposed to twice in normal mode.  It is set up to use the same password as the main router.  In this mode, the device creates a new WiFi SSID for devices to attach to.<br /><br />The downside is that your device (iPhone, for example) decides when to leave and join networks.  It doesn't necessarily switch seamlessly between available networks.  So, if you are near the router, and enable Wifi, your phone will join the router WiFi.  If you then walk to the other room, it may eventually switch over to the extender WiFi, but usually not without a disruption in internet.  So, you find yourself manually choosing the WiFi sometimes.<br /><br />I suppose that mesh system would have a better user experience.  But, those are a lot more expensive.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "This product is marketed incorrectly and mislabeled by the manufacturer", "text": "Let's be perfectly clear.... a WiFi range extender should not create an entirely NEW wireless network. It should extend and repeat an EXISTING wireless network. This device does the former and not the latter.<br /><br />While that may be perfectly suitable for devices that are stationary, it is simply not the case for those that move around a house regularly. Most wireless devices want to connect to and HOLD a connection regardless of how weak the signal is. So, with this device creating two new networks that link back to the existing wireless network(s), your devices are somehow supposed to divine when it's best to connect to one versus the other. That simply won't happen, because it belies the nature of WiFi. Your roaming devices will sit there and spin while trying to pull data from a weak connection before they'll drop that connection and join the stronger network, unless you've implemented some sort of intelligence that knows to do just that.

I did. One of that. I took it out of the box, plugged it into a wall outlet next to my router, waited 1 minute for it to boot up, pressed WPS button on extender, then pressed WPS button on my router, waited 1 minute & it connected (If that fails unplug extender & retry process). I then unplugged the extender, walked out to my garage & plugged it into an outlet inside my garage next to a window (idk if thenwindow matters) and boom I\u2019m getting great connection & speeds. 4 Stars only due to the instruction booklet being a complete mess but it was quite simple for me.

I did on a very old device that isn't used any more (and now I'm wondering what junk he uploaded) and he told me that I had all sorts of issues, but for the one time low price of $299 he could fix it and get the device connected forever or for a low yearly price of $149 he would get the device connected.<br />What a SCAM! I refused the service and hung up, then I removed all traces of program that he used to log in and promptly returned this.  I am now the proud owner of a Linksys wifi extender that was so easy to use! Just plugged it in and it connected immediately.  No issues.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Set up - Very easy out of the box", "text": "First off, I did receive this Model: EX6120 directly from Netgear to test and review, but my review will be completely non-bias.<br /><br />Set up - Very easy out of the box. I tested both the WPS method as well as going through the web browser. Both were a breeze, but the WPS is much faster. If you have that capability on your current wireless router. I recommend it just for the ease of setting it up. However, if you want to custom name the extender, then you have to go through the web setup.<br /><br />Features - 802.11ac, Dual Band, Gigabit, Wall-plug, External Antennas. The nice thing about this extender, is that it does work with both old and newer type of wireless routers. I tried it on both an older ASUS router as well as my newer Netgear Nighthawk. Both worked seamlessly with setup, but there was a difference in the range. More on that below.<br /><br />Performance - This was a little tricky because I have a pretty large 2 story house at 3400 sqft and my office with the wireless modem is located on the bottom floor corner of the house. So placement was a tricky for getting a good signal to the upstairs master bedroom on the complete opposite side of the house. I first tried placing the extender in the middle of the upstairs hallway, which is about dead middle between the wireless modem in my office and my master bedroom. The signal from my devices to the extender was great, but the extender would not keep a good solid connection to the wireless router downstairs, so I had to move the extender into the guest bedroom down the hallway, which is right above wireless router. That seemed to work much better and the extender keeps a good connection with the router while still giving me a good connection to my devices in the master bedroom.<br />There was a difference in speed in trying both the ASUS router and the Netgear Nighthawk.I tested both one right after the other and found the new Nighthawk edged out the ASUS by about 15 Mbps faster. Which if your doing normal browsing may not make a big difference, but for video, it certainly can effect the playback and can be quite frustrating if your video keeps buffering or freezing up.<br /><br />I think for the cost, this does a pretty dang good job and would recommend it for smaller homes than mine. However, I think for a larger home, stepping up to the EX6200 or even the EX7000 would be much better. If your wireless modem is located in middle of your home, that can male a big difference as well.<br /><br />Another note; if you have a slow internet connection coming into the house, such as an old crappy DSL service, no extender will help speed things up. I happen to have Comcast Cable and it's screaming fast (100+ Mbps), which certainly helps. Especially if you connect multiple devices at once. The extender only works as good as the signal getting to it. The more speed, the better it works!<br /><br />Hope this helps!", "images": [], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AEFHHTTXWH5ATWSWTNO5CWUY523Q", "timestamp": 1447024792000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

So.....I went to the website,and guess what?...the instructions there are slightly different. Still no luck. So I register the device so that I can get free support, but support isn't available until the following day. Frustrated I read back through the Amazon reviews and the first one I read has the key word I'm looking for. Ah! You have to access it wirelessly (like a laptop) to set it up. All this time I had tried to do it with my desktop which has a LAN connection to my router. That's why I wasn't accessing it, but of course the factory instructions really don't cover that. So anyway, got it all set up and working. Moved it to the mid-point in my house to where it 'should' help extend the coverage and it helps by maybe 1 bar. GRRRR. I've also found that after it sits for a while, it loses contact with my router. DOUBLE-GRRRR! Lastly, it doesn't really work like I thought it would. What it does, is establish ANOTHER address for your equipment to use. So, for instance, if your network is named 'MyNetwork', then when you have this device attach itself to your network you end up with 'another' network named 'MyNetwork_2EXT' (or 5EXT). That is your network extension for your devices to attach to when your regular network isn't reaching. So that means you have to put your password in your devices for this new network as well. Anyway, I think it has fallen short of my expectations and I'll be looking for something else to fill in the gaps.

So once i plug it in, i go to my computer ( any mobile device with wifi will work), and search for wifi networks, it will show a network along the lines of NETGEAR_EXT. So you connect then open a web browser and it will direct you to the page to setup the extender, allowing you to select which networks and what types of ffrequencies to allow.

I had high hopes for this thing, and was completely disappointed.<br /><br />I have an older no name JCG JWA-N8002 300M repeater which I was using for 4years which used only 2.4GHz. Since I have had 5GHz for a while now, I thought to upgrade it as I kept get interference on the 2.4GHz from the microwave oven of all things on the old repeater.<br /><br />Well I got this Netgear and the first issue was the setup. It was straightforward and since I'm tech professional I could easily set it up.<br />The limitation of the fast speed setup others had mentioned was there. You can only use one band for either up or down stream when setting up for fast speed configuration.<br />i.e For the Fast speed. So 2.4ghz for Repeater to Router, 5Ghz for Repeater to devices or vice versa. No problem.<br /><br />I tried that setting and didn't see much improvement beyond how it was working. For me the distance from router to unit is literally 15Ft. Yes the router is in the next room so I wasn't bothered by fast speed or regular, I just needed it to work and not be disturbed by my microwave oven.<br /><br />All I really used it for was to bridge the wifi to Lan and use the lan connection on the repeater.<br /><br />It worked quite fine and then I noticed the main issue which earned it this 1 star review.<br /><br />IT KEPT DROPPING THE CONNECTION. NO JOKE!<br /><br />It would work for a while (30MINS) and then would drop the connection for less than 10 seconds and then continue.<br />This would seem fine at first until you start streaming or moving files then it becomes a real pain.<br /><br />I tried to change configurations, I changed the upstream/downsteam. I switched it to use only 2.4 or only 5Ghz. Same thing. I switch channels on Router and tried the fast speed. Nope. Same behavior. Dropped connections regularly.<br />I tried so many different things instead of just sending it back for refund during that refund window. It still dropped connections.<br /><br />So in the end, I went back to my old repeater and bought a new microwave which no longer interferes with the 2.4Ghz connection. I have had no dropped connections on my old repeater since then.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Be patient and call Amazon", "text": "I went through the proverbial ringer with this wifi range extender AC1200.  I had an old Netgear extender and an old router from my internet service provider.  The old router was replaced.  The old extender didn't communicate with the new router.  I tried and tried and failed.  Somehow I got through on the phone with the Netgear tech support - that is a feat in itself.  Round and round we went, trying all kinds of options, and failed to reconfigure the old extender to the new router.  Threw up my hands in frustration and selected a new moderately priced Netgear - the AC1200.  Well, configuring IT was a nightmare too.  I tried for a solid hour before I went through all kinds of machinations and FINALLY got a tech support on the line.  When he couldn't get it configured, he suggested shadowing my computer to make it work.  I was hesitant, but after I shied away from that suggestion on the Old extender tech call, I thought okay - come access my computer and let's get this configured.  Well, after I asked him if he was going to actually be doing things on my computer or would he be directing me, he sounded like he was threatening me to jump ship, abandon the call and leave me to my own devices (no pun).  No no, I said, please help me.  After 45 minutes on the phone with him, he began to tell me about some system configuration he was going to have to do and called up some text edit program which I didn't understand and then started upselling me to a major job that I was just not comfortable with.  I told him I'd have to sleep on it and he was really kind of rude, chastening me that I was the one that called THEM for help.  But, you know when you're talking overseas to someone, it does get a little nerve wracking to think that I'm being asked to lay bare my computer before a complete stranger.  I said no thank you.  I just planned to return it to Amazon.  I started that process and made the choice to have an Amazon representative call me.  Christine was patient and kind.  She asked for some basic information and then directed me step by itty bitty step until LO AND BEHOLD! my wife extender is now configured, up and running.  I don't know where she's from or anything about her at all except this:  SHE was helpful and a breath of fresh air compared to dealing with the NETGEAR tech.  So, if you have ANY difficulty installing your extender - don't waste time with the NETGEAR support - just call Amazon support on the page where you're choosing to return the item - it's one of the choices you can use there and they call you right away - even at 9:30 pm. I'm sure the extender is going to work top notch like the other one did - but NETGEAR Support is the main reason I won't give it a 5 rating.", "images": [], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AF5OPM7PLWUOJWFRQKIA5XWZMZVQ", "timestamp": 1609384897879, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true}

The initial installation was not very smooth but was not too bad. Auto setup didn't work, so I had to do web-browser setup, extra steps, but was okay. After setup, I moved the extender to 2nd floor, and got very strong signal on my smart TV, very happy! But my thrill only lasted for a day. I started to notice interruption with my router signal, occasionally. But the most frustrating thing was that the extender frequently lost connection to the smart TV, and the &#34;DEVICE&#34; indicator stayed in solid red. I had the turn the power off and back on to reconnect, very frustrating. I called the customer service (by the way, I had to register first, then was given 1-408-638-4327. The area code was California, but the service center was in India). First rep directed me to update the software. It didn't solve the problem. Called again, second rep said, &#34;no, no, you don't need to update software. You need to reset the extender.&#34; That didn't solve the problem either. Then she said my extender was too far to the router. I knew it was not the issue since the &#34;ROUTER&#34; indicator stayed solid green. But I followed her instruction anyway. It was not helpful, then she asked me to reset again. Enough was enough!!!  I hanged up the phone, and was upset because I felt that my time was wasted and I couldn't get real help from knowledgeable service rep.

I've had multiple support tickets opened for the product. Result is always the same. It works for a while and then can no longer connect to router.<br /><br />The extender loses internet and restores itself to factory settings and requires a complete set up to make it work again. Hardware support from NetGear is lacking the ability to resolve this problem. Worst product from NetGear I've had.<br /><br />Update Dec 6, 2019<br /><br />Again this review is for the Nighthawk X6S AC3000 (EX8000) Tri-band WiFi Mesh Extender. I received a replacement extender. It worked for about 5-6 weeks then it stopped working. I had to go through the entire setup procedure again for it to work. Now, seven DAYS later and it stopped working again.<br /><br />Whatever you do, don't buy the RAX120 (previously reviewed) or the EX8000. These are expensive and unstable. If you get 90 days out of them without a problem consider yourself lucky. Once you pass the 90 day mark NetGear won't provide phone support. These products are the worst home WiFi equipment I have ever owned.<br /><br />---------- Previous Update ----------<br />This review is for the Nighthawk X6S AC3000 (EX8000) Tri-band WiFi Mesh Extender even though Amazon is unable to distinguish this review from a previous review for a different Netgear product (EX6120). That product performed so poorly: weak signal, unable to connect to main router, that I returned it.<br /><br />This particular product, the EX8000 worked great for the first 90 days and then it stopped working. Only one light would come on. Power cycling the device did not help. Pressing the factory reset button did not help either.<br /><br />It is now beyond the 90 day support window and too late to return it to Amazon. The product warranty is good for one year. Currently, trying to get Netgear support to replace the defective product.<br /><br />As a note, this is not the first Netgear product I have trouble with.

For many years I used a Netgear WNCE2001 802.11n wifi to Ethernet device, and I cannot say enough about the old Netgear.  Honestly I configured the old device exactly *one* time, and there was never a problem over ~10 year use!  So, now I need faster wifi (802.11ac) to Ethernet, and the EX6120 has the right specs.  Setup was a bit troublesome, but the device seems to be working pretty.  Over the past two weeks I needed to power-cycle the device one time.  Definitely not rock-solid like the old Netgear device, but pretty good.  Negatives: No log file that I could find, which would help when debugging network problems.  The factory reset button doesn't seem to reset the device completely; I think this is considered a &#34;feature&#34;, but I would prefer a real factory reset.  The biggest challenge was diagnosing the dreaded &#34;The DFS channel is not allowed to use because the Radar was detected before&#34;; Netgear could do better with describing the problem *and* please give me a log file showing what happened and when it happened.  In the end I changed my home router (AT&T Pace 5268AC) to a non-DFS channel, and now the Netgear seems satisfied.

None of my other wifi devices , and  I have many, gave me a problem with connection to my wifi services. I contacted the help line associated with Netgear online and was connected with a representative who called me back on my phone. I gave  \"Frank\" access to my computer screen  so he could help me. He determined that my computer was \"infected\" and wanted to have permission to install a firewall for $145 dollars for 3 years. This is when I became alarmed and told him so. Remember, he called me when I gave my telephone number to the online help service so I really didn't know if I was still dealing with Netgear. I asked him how I could be sure I was giving permission  for a firewall installation  to a reputable source and said I would just like to return the merchandise . He said my money would not be returned because it wasn't the device .They would send another and the problem would be the same . I let him know I suspected the device I received was already returned once because of the scratch on the front.

The person walked me through the installation instructions but when the lights didn't come on they asked to remote into my computer because there was a network problem.  I didn't allow them to remote into my computer, but instead kept asking questions about the alleged network problem.  The person then hung up on me!  Shortly after I realized I needed to push the button on my router in addition to the button on the extender....boom it worked.

So my laptop, tablets and phone can all connect both to my main router and to the extender.  Once the password is saved, most devices will connect to the strongest signal, so when I am farthest from the main router, my tablet automatically connects to the extender.<br /><br />One feature that I found really useful was &#34;FastLane Technology.&#34;  If your main router supports dual band, you can connect from the main router to the extender on one band (in my case, 5GHz), and it repeats out on the 2.4 GHz band.  This provides better performance than having the extender function as a repeater on both bands at the same time.<br /><br />So far, the extender has been reliable, stays connected, is trouble-free and allows my &#34;TV room&#34; to use a FireTVstick, my TV itself to log onto the internet, and my DirecTV DVR to access On Demand content over the internet, even though my main router's signal there was just too weak to work.", "images": [], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AFIWZOGEDB44TBWLVNZVS4OVQGZA", "timestamp": 1481625967000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": true}

If you are simply looking for a way to extend your network to parts of the house that do not have coverage and do not care if the speed is incredibly fast for those devices, then this is perfect for you.  Using the device to extend my 2.4ghz network on my dual-band TP-Link TL-WDR3600, I was able to reach networks speeds with a solid connection at around 270mbps anywhere in the house.  Normally, I get around 300mbps when connected with a good signal to my router, so that's pretty good.  (It's always a trade-off between range and speed when extending the range wirelessly through a wirelessly-connected device).  The 5ghz range, however, is pretty bad.  Unless I have the extender plugged into the same room as the router, I cannot even access the Internet (and am barely able to access the network) on the 5ghz extended network.  What's even stranger:  I can connect to the 5ghz network on my router and browse at reduced speeds.  So the extender actually is performing worse than the router.  I will experiment with checking the channels of my devices (wireless TVs and the Dish Hopper 3) and making sure they do not interfere with the selected channels on my range extender, but I find that unlikely to be the case being I've tested this with those devices powered off and get the same results.<br /><br />In closing, if you need network coverage over the 2.4ghz network and don't mind a hit to your connection speed, get this device.  Do not get this thinking it will improve your speed or that you'll magically have 5ghz blazing-fast speeds on the opposite end of a large 3000sq.ft. house going through walls.

I am computer literate and have worked in IT for the last 28 years.  What I found was the extender would see both of my dual band networks and would authenticate but the 5g Network would indicate it didn't have internet access and devices would not connect to it.  I had tried down-reving the firmware to see if it was related to that.  I was working on it about 2 feet from my current wifi router.  I tried moving my current channels around which made no differnce.  I tried using WPS and let it configure itself.  All of those attempts produced the same results.  What I did discover is: I could do a reset and start over and disable all 2g and only configure the 5g and it seemed to work ok for 5g only now.  I then tried manually configuring/adding back in the 2g and now it wouldn't connect or work over 2g.  I put it where I wanted to extend my access and I left it overnight and it had an error and wasnt connected without a reboot the next day.<br /><br />I had read reviews about how bad Netgear support was but that I had 90 days of it.  So I thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt and try submitting a ticket with them.  I indicated my issue and went over the above in the comments about what I had tried to do.  They basically came back and asked me all the information I had just provided them.  Questions like is 5g turned on, the router distance, have I tried a hard reset, what channels I was using etc.  To which I went back and retold them those answers.  I then was asked to move the router closer and check again and now they wanted to know what my router IP address was.  As this point I could see I was going to go nowhere with them and started my Amazon Return process... (Thank you Amazon!!!).  I just received a third email today from another tech asking me to try changing my wifi channels and try downgrading my firmware and how to perform a hard reset.<br /><br />I don't think Netgear support reads your emails/comments I think they just sound out some canned responses and probably wait until you give up running in circles or until 90 days passes.  My recommendation is don't waste your time with this extender and now I am jaded about even recommending Netgear even though I have had an older dual band R6300 for a few years that has been good to me.", "images": [], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AFA2X3C7GLPJUYQHW6JC3IUVHAZA", "timestamp": 1468945607000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

I looked into my WiFi list and saw my router with the -ext ending on my 5G (I went through the setup twice as written if you gave 5G) then typed in my WiFi password and I was connected!<br />I plugged it into my kitchen which is halfway and after maybe 3 minutes both lights were lit green as you can see from my picture! I then took my cell phone to my bedroom (last room as far from my router as I could be) found the WiFi in my phone settings under WiFi clicked on the one with 5G-ext at end, typed in my password and voila!!! I am able to search quickly where I did not have any WiFi before!! Within 10 minutes of opening the package my day has begun and I\u2019m a much happier person this morning. Thank you Netgear for making such a wonderful product!!!", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hmGfAaXGL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hmGfAaXGL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hmGfAaXGL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B014YN7LVE", "parent_asin": "B014YN7LVE", "user_id": "AFKPJCRKTDZRMWY52Q6E7EYYW3YA", "timestamp": 1550057236553, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

I tried the hard reset and the problem would reoccur.  I would unplug and reboot and I could connect but again after several hours, the same problem persisted.<br /><br />I reviewed several reviews online and decided to upload the older firmware version as suggested.<br /><br />After several uploads of the different older firmware versions, version V1.0.0.40_1.0.25 did the trick.<br /><br />I no longer have issues with the wifi dropping and have consistent coverage with the extender without dropping.<br /><br />While the newest firmware should have solved the problem, it has not.
